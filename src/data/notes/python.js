# Wireless Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks

WSNs are an emerging application field of microelectronics and communications. They promise wide support of interactions between people and their surroundings.

### Key Aspects:
- **Wireless**: Freedom from wires, mobility support, easy deployment.
- **Sensor**: Capability to perceive and interact with the world.
- **Networks**: plurality of communicating devices distributed over large areas.
