1.2 Wireless Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks: The Ancestors without IP Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) were an emerging application field of microelectronics and communications in the first decade of the twenty-first century. In particular, WSNs promised wide support of interactions between people and their surroundings. The potential of a WSN can be seen in the three words behind the acronym: • “Wireless” puts the focus on the freedom that the elimination of wires gives, in terms of mobility support and ease of system deployment; • “Sensor” reflects the capability of sensing technology to provide the means to perceive and interact — in a wide sense — with the world; • “Networks” gives emphasis to the possibility of building systems whose functional capabilities are given by a plurality of communicating devices, possibly distributed over large areas.
