We saw another kind, using a \nfor loop, in Section 4.2. In this chapter we\u2019ll see yet another kind, using a while statement. \nBut \ufb01rst I want to say a little more about variable assignment. \n\n7.1 \nReassignment \n\nAs you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same \nvariable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop \nreferring to the old value). \n\n>>> x = 5 \n>>> x \n5 \n>>> x = 7 \n>>> x \n7 \n\nThe \ufb01rst time we display x , its value is 5; the second time, its value is 7. \n\nFigure 7.1 shows what reassignment looks like in a state diagram. \n\nAt this point I want to address a common source of confusion. Because Python uses the \nequal sign ( = ) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a mathe- \nmatical proposition of equality; that is, the claim that a and b are equal. But this interpre- \ntation is wrong. \n\nFirst, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For example, in math- \nematics, if a = 7 then 7 = a . But in Python, the statement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is \nnot. \n\nAlso, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or false for all time. If a = \nb now, then a will always equal b . In Python, an assignment statement can make two \nvariables equal, but they don\u2019t have to stay that way: \n\n64 \nChapter 7. Iteration \n\n7 \n\n5 \nx \n\nFigure 7.1: State diagram. \n\n>>> a = 5 \n>>> b = a \n# a and b are now equal \n>>> a = 3 \n# a and b are no longer equal \n>>> b \n5 \n\nThe third line changes the value of a but does not change the value of b , so they are no \nlonger equal. \n\nReassigning variables is often useful, but you should use it with caution. If the values of \nvariables change frequently, it can make the code dif\ufb01cult to read and debug. \n\n7.2 \nUpdating variables \n\nA common kind of reassignment is an update , where the new value of the variable depends \non the old. \n\n>>> x = x + 1 \n\nThis means \u201cget the current value of x , add one, and then update x with the new value.\u201d \n\nIf you try to update a variable that doesn\u2019t exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates \nthe right side before it assigns a value to x : \n\n>>> x = x + 1 \nNameError: name 'x' is not defined \n\nBefore you can update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assign- \nment: \n\n>>> x = 0 \n>>> x = x + 1 \n\nUpdating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment ; subtracting 1 is called a decrement . \n\n7.3 \nThe while statement \n\nComputers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks \nwithout making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. In a \ncomputer program, repetition is also called iteration . \n\nWe have already seen two functions, countdown and print_n , that iterate using recursion. \nBecause iteration is so common, Python provides language features to make it easier. One \nis the for statement we saw in Section 4.2. We\u2019ll get back to that later. \n\nAnother is the while statement. Here is a version of countdown that uses a while statement: \n\n7.3. The while statement \n65 \n\ndef countdown(n): \nwhile n > 0: \nprint(n) \nn = n - 1 \nprint('Blastoff!') \n\nYou can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, \u201cWhile n is greater \nthan 0, display the value of n and then decrement n . When you get to 0, display the word \nBlastoff! \u201d \n\nMore formally, here is the \ufb02ow of execution for a while statement: \n\n1. Determine whether the condition is true or false. \n\n2. If false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement. \n\n3. If the condition is true, run the body and then go back to step 1. \n\nThis type of \ufb02ow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. \n\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that the condition \nbecomes false eventually and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, \nwhich is called an in\ufb01nite loop . An endless source of amusement for computer scientists \nis the observation that the directions on shampoo, \u201cLather, rinse, repeat\u201d, are an in\ufb01nite \nloop. \n\nIn the case of countdown , we can prove that the loop terminates: if n is zero or negative, the \nloop never runs. Otherwise, n gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we \nhave to get to 0. \n\nFor some other loops, it is not so easy to tell. For example: \n\ndef sequence(n): \nwhile n != 1: \nprint(n) \nif n % 2 == 0: \n# n is even \nn = n / 2 \nelse: \n# n is odd \nn = n*3 + 1 \n\nThe condition for this loop is n != 1 , so the loop will continue until n is 1 , which makes \nthe condition false. \n\nEach time through the loop, the program outputs the value of n and then checks whether \nit is even or odd. If it is even, n is divided by 2. If it is odd, the value of n is replaced with \nn*3 + 1 . For example, if the argument passed to sequence is 3, the resulting values of n \nare 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. \n\nSince n sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that n will \never reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values of n , we can prove \ntermination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, n will be even every \ntime through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence, \nstarting with 16. \n\nThe hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates for all posi- \ntive values of n . \nSo far, no one has been able to prove it or disprove it! \n(See http: \n//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture .) \n\n66 \nChapter 7. Iteration \n\nAs an exercise, rewrite the function print_n from Section 5.8 using iteration instead of \nrecursion. \n\n7.4 \nbreak \n\nSometimes you don\u2019t know it\u2019s time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. \nIn that case you can use the break statement to jump out of the loop. \n\nFor example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type done . You could \nwrite: \nwhile True: \nline = input('> ') \nif line == 'done': \nbreak \nprint(line) \n\nprint('Done!') \nThe loop condition is True , which is always true, so the loop runs until it hits the break \nstatement. \n\nEach time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types done , the \nbreak statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and \ngoes back to the top of the loop. Here\u2019s a sample run: \n> not done \nnot done \n> done \nDone! \nThis way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere \nin the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition af\ufb01rmatively (\u201cstop \nwhen this happens\u201d) rather than negatively (\u201ckeep going until that happens\u201d). \n\n7.5 \nSquare roots \n\nLoops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an ap- \nproximate answer and iteratively improving it. \n\nFor example, one way of computing square roots is Newton\u2019s method. Suppose that you \nwant to know the square root of a . If you start with almost any estimate, x , you can com- \npute a better estimate with the following formula: \n\ny = x + a / x \n\n2 \nFor example, if a is 4 and x is 3: \n>>> a = 4 \n>>> x = 3 \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.16666666667 \n\n7.6. Algorithms \n67 \n\nThe result is closer to the correct answer ( \n\u221a \n\n4 = 2). If we repeat the process with the new \nestimate, it gets even closer: \n\n>>> x = y \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.00641025641 \n\nAfter a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact: \n\n>>> x = y \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.00001024003 \n>>> x = y \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.00000000003 \n\nIn general we don\u2019t know ahead of time how many steps it takes to get to the right answer, \nbut we know when we get there because the estimate stops changing: \n\n>>> x = y \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.0 \n>>> x = y \n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 \n>>> y \n2.0 \n\nWhen y == x , we can stop. Here is a loop that starts with an initial estimate, x , and im- \nproves it until it stops changing: \n\nwhile True: \nprint(x) \ny = (x + a/x) / 2 \nif y == x: \nbreak \nx = y \n\nFor most values of a this works \ufb01ne, but in general it is dangerous to test float equality. \nFloating-point values are only approximately right: most rational numbers, like 1/3, and \nirrational numbers, like \n\u221a \n\n2, can\u2019t be represented exactly with a float . \n\nRather than checking whether x and y are exactly equal, it is safer to use the built-in func- \ntion abs to compute the absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them: \n\nif abs(y-x) < epsilon: \nbreak \n\nWhere epsilon has a value like 0.0000001 that determines how close is close enough. \n\n7.6 \nAlgorithms \n\nNewton\u2019s method is an example of an algorithm : it is a mechanical process for solving a \ncategory of problems (in this case, computing square roots). \n\n68 \nChapter 7. Iteration \n\nTo understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an \nalgorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized \nthe multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 speci\ufb01c solutions. That kind of \nknowledge is not algorithmic. \n\nBut if you were \u201clazy\u201d, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to \ufb01nd the \nproduct of n and 9, you can write n \u2212 1 as the \ufb01rst digit and 10 \u2212 n as the second digit. \nThis trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That\u2019s an \nalgorithm! \n\nSimilarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow- \ning, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that \nthey do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where \neach step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules. \n\nExecuting algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challeng- \ning, and a central part of computer science. \n\nSome of the things that people do naturally, without dif\ufb01culty or conscious thought, are \nthe hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. \nWe all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form \nof an algorithm. \n\n7.7 \nDebugging \n\nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might \ufb01nd yourself spending more time debug- \nging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide. \n\nOne way to cut your debugging time is \u201cdebugging by bisection\u201d. For example, if there \nare 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps. \n\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for \nan intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a \nveri\ufb01able effect) and run the program. \n\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the \ufb01rst half of the program. \nIf it is correct, the problem is in the second half. \n\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. \nAfter six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, \nat least in theory. \n\nIn practice it is not always clear what the \u201cmiddle of the program\u201d is and not always pos- \nsible to check it. It doesn\u2019t make sense to count lines and \ufb01nd the exact midpoint. Instead, \nthink about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy \nto put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that \nthe bug is before or after the check. \n\n7.8 \nGlossary \n\nreassignment: Assigning a new value to a variable that already exists. \n\n7.9. Exercises \n69 \n\nupdate: An assignment where the new value of the variable depends on the old. \n\ninitialization: An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated. \n\nincrement: An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one). \n\ndecrement: An update that decreases the value of a variable. \n\niteration: Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a recursive function call \nor a loop. \n\nin\ufb01nite loop: A loop in which the terminating condition is never satis\ufb01ed. \n\nalgorithm: A general process for solving a category of problems. \n\n7.9 \nExercises \n\nExercise 7.1. Copy the loop from Section 7.5 and encapsulate it in a function called mysqrt that \ntakes a as a parameter, chooses a reasonable value of x , and returns an estimate of the square root of \na . \n\nTo test it, write a function named test_square_root that prints a table like this: \n\na \nmysqrt(a) \nmath.sqrt(a) \ndiff \n- \n--------- \n------------ \n---- \n1.0 1.0 \n1.0 \n0.0 \n2.0 1.41421356237 1.41421356237 2.22044604925e-16 \n3.0 1.73205080757 1.73205080757 0.0 \n4.0 2.0 \n2.0 \n0.0 \n5.0 2.2360679775 \n2.2360679775 \n0.0 \n6.0 2.44948974278 2.44948974278 0.0 \n7.0 2.64575131106 2.64575131106 0.0 \n8.0 2.82842712475 2.82842712475 4.4408920985e-16 \n9.0 3.0 \n3.0 \n0.0 \n\nThe \ufb01rst column is a number, a; the second column is the square root of a computed with mysqrt ; \nthe third column is the square root computed by math.sqrt ; the fourth column is the absolute value \nof the difference between the two estimates. \nExercise 7.2. The built-in function eval takes a string and evaluates it using the Python inter- \npreter. For example: \n\n>>> eval('1 + 2 * 3') \n7 \n>>> import math \n>>> eval('math.sqrt(5)') \n2.2360679774997898 \n>>> eval('type(math.pi)') \n<class 'float'> \n\nWrite a function called eval_loop that iteratively prompts the user, takes the resulting input and \nevaluates it using eval , and prints the result. \n\nIt should continue until the user enters 'done' , and then return the value of the last expression it \nevaluated. \n\n70 \nChapter 7. Iteration \n\nExercise 7.3. The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an in\ufb01nite series that can be used to \ngenerate a numerical approximation of 1/ \u03c0 : \n\n1 \n\u03c0 = 2 \n\u221a \n\n2 \n9801 \n\n\u221e \n\u2211 \nk = 0 \n\n( 4 k ) ! ( 1103 + 26390 k ) \n\n( k ! ) 4 396 4 k \n\nWrite a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate of \n\u03c0 . It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is smaller than \n1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10 \u2212 15 ). You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi . \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ pi. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n\n",
