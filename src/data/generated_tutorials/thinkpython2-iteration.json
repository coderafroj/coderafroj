We saw another kind, using a for loop, in Section 4.2. In this chapter we\u2019ll see yet another kind, using a while statement. But \ufb01rst I want to say a little more about variable assignment. \n\n7.1 Reassignment \n\nAs you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value). \n\n>>> x = 5 >>> x 5 >>> x = 7 >>> x 7 \n\nThe \ufb01rst time we display x, its value is 5; the second time, its value is 7. \n\nFigure 7.1 shows what reassignment looks like in a state diagram. \n\nAt this point I want to address a common source of confusion. Because Python uses the equal sign (=) for assignment, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a mathe- matical proposition of equality; that is, the claim that a and b are equal. But this interpre- tation is wrong. \n\nFirst, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For example, in math- ematics, if a = 7 then 7 = a. But in Python, the statement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is not. \n\nAlso, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or false for all time. If a = b now, then a will always equal b. In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don\u2019t have to stay that way: \n\n64 Chapter 7. Iteration \n\n7 \n\n5 x \n\nFigure 7.1: State diagram. \n\n>>> a = 5 >>> b = a # a and b are now equal >>> a = 3 # a and b are no longer equal >>> b 5 \n\nThe third line changes the value of a but does not change the value of b, so they are no longer equal. \n\nReassigning variables is often useful, but you should use it with caution. If the values of variables change frequently, it can make the code dif\ufb01cult to read and debug. \n\n7.2 Updating variables \n\nA common kind of reassignment is an update, where the new value of the variable depends on the old. \n\n>>> x = x + 1 \n\nThis means \u201cget the current value of x, add one, and then update x with the new value.\u201d \n\nIf you try to update a variable that doesn\u2019t exist, you get an error, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns a value to x: \n\n>>> x = x + 1 NameError: name 'x' is not defined \n\nBefore you can update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assign- ment: \n\n>>> x = 0 >>> x = x + 1 \n\nUpdating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment; subtracting 1 is called a decrement. \n\n7.3 The while statement \n\nComputers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly. In a computer program, repetition is also called iteration. \n\nWe have already seen two functions, countdown and print_n, that iterate using recursion. Because iteration is so common, Python provides language features to make it easier. One is the for statement we saw in Section 4.2. We\u2019ll get back to that later. \n\nAnother is the while statement. Here is a version of countdown that uses a while statement: \n\n7.3. The while statement 65 \n\ndef countdown(n): while n > 0: print(n) n = n - 1 print('Blastoff!') \n\nYou can almost read the while statement as if it were English. It means, \u201cWhile n is greater than 0, display the value of n and then decrement n. When you get to 0, display the word Blastoff!\u201d \n\nMore formally, here is the \ufb02ow of execution for a while statement: \n\n1. Determine whether the condition is true or false. \n\n2. If false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement. \n\n3. If the condition is true, run the body and then go back to step 1. \n\nThis type of \ufb02ow is called a loop because the third step loops back around to the top. \n\nThe body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that the condition becomes false eventually and the loop terminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an in\ufb01nite loop. An endless source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo, \u201cLather, rinse, repeat\u201d, are an in\ufb01nite loop. \n\nIn the case of countdown, we can prove that the loop terminates: if n is zero or negative, the loop never runs. Otherwise, n gets smaller each time through the loop, so eventually we have to get to 0. \n\nFor some other loops, it is not so easy to tell. For example: \n\ndef sequence(n): while n != 1: print(n) if n % 2 == 0: # n is even n = n / 2 else: # n is odd n = n*3 + 1 \n\nThe condition for this loop is n != 1, so the loop will continue until n is 1, which makes the condition false. \n\nEach time through the loop, the program outputs the value of n and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, n is divided by 2. If it is odd, the value of n is replaced with n*3 + 1. For example, if the argument passed to sequence is 3, the resulting values of n are 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. \n\nSince n sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious proof that n will ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some particular values of n, we can prove termination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, n will be even every time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence, starting with 16. \n\nThe hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates for all posi- tive values of n. So far, no one has been able to prove it or disprove it! (See http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture.) \n\n66 Chapter 7. Iteration \n\nAs an exercise, rewrite the function print_n from Section 5.8 using iteration instead of recursion. \n\n7.4 break \n\nSometimes you don\u2019t know it\u2019s time to end a loop until you get half way through the body. In that case you can use the break statement to jump out of the loop. \n\nFor example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they type done. You could write: while True: line = input('> ') if line == 'done': break print(line) \n\nprint('Done!') The loop condition is True, which is always true, so the loop runs until it hits the break statement. \n\nEach time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket. If the user types done, the break statement exits the loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types and goes back to the top of the loop. Here\u2019s a sample run: > not done not done > done Done! This way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition af\ufb01rmatively (\u201cstop when this happens\u201d) rather than negatively (\u201ckeep going until that happens\u201d). \n\n7.5 Square roots \n\nLoops are often used in programs that compute numerical results by starting with an ap- proximate answer and iteratively improving it. \n\nFor example, one way of computing square roots is Newton\u2019s method. Suppose that you want to know the square root of a. If you start with almost any estimate, x, you can com- pute a better estimate with the following formula: \n\ny = x + a/x \n\n2 For example, if a is 4 and x is 3: >>> a = 4 >>> x = 3 >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.16666666667 \n\n7.6. Algorithms 67 \n\nThe result is closer to the correct answer ( \u221a \n\n4 = 2). If we repeat the process with the new estimate, it gets even closer: \n\n>>> x = y >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.00641025641 \n\nAfter a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact: \n\n>>> x = y >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.00001024003 >>> x = y >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.00000000003 \n\nIn general we don\u2019t know ahead of time how many steps it takes to get to the right answer, but we know when we get there because the estimate stops changing: \n\n>>> x = y >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.0 >>> x = y >>> y = (x + a/x) / 2 >>> y 2.0 \n\nWhen y == x, we can stop. Here is a loop that starts with an initial estimate, x, and im- proves it until it stops changing: \n\nwhile True: print(x) y = (x + a/x) / 2 if y == x: break x = y \n\nFor most values of a this works \ufb01ne, but in general it is dangerous to test float equality. Floating-point values are only approximately right: most rational numbers, like 1/3, and irrational numbers, like \u221a \n\n2, can\u2019t be represented exactly with a float. \n\nRather than checking whether x and y are exactly equal, it is safer to use the built-in func- tion abs to compute the absolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them: \n\nif abs(y-x) < epsilon: break \n\nWhere epsilon has a value like 0.0000001 that determines how close is close enough. \n\n7.6 Algorithms \n\nNewton\u2019s method is an example of an algorithm: it is a mechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this case, computing square roots). \n\n68 Chapter 7. Iteration \n\nTo understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with something that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply single-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table. In effect, you memorized 100 speci\ufb01c solutions. That kind of knowledge is not algorithmic. \n\nBut if you were \u201clazy\u201d, you might have learned a few tricks. For example, to \ufb01nd the product of n and 9, you can write n \u22121 as the \ufb01rst digit and 10 \u2212n as the second digit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any single-digit number by 9. That\u2019s an algorithm! \n\nSimilarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrow- ing, and long division are all algorithms. One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules. \n\nExecuting algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting, intellectually challeng- ing, and a central part of computer science. \n\nSome of the things that people do naturally, without dif\ufb01culty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm. \n\n7.7 Debugging \n\nAs you start writing bigger programs, you might \ufb01nd yourself spending more time debug- ging. More code means more chances to make an error and more places for bugs to hide. \n\nOne way to cut your debugging time is \u201cdebugging by bisection\u201d. For example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you check them one at a time, it would take 100 steps. \n\nInstead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle of the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you can check. Add a print statement (or something else that has a veri\ufb01able effect) and run the program. \n\nIf the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the \ufb01rst half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is in the second half. \n\nEvery time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of lines you have to search. After six steps (which is fewer than 100), you would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory. \n\nIn practice it is not always clear what the \u201cmiddle of the program\u201d is and not always pos- sible to check it. It doesn\u2019t make sense to count lines and \ufb01nd the exact midpoint. Instead, think about places in the program where there might be errors and places where it is easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you think the chances are about the same that the bug is before or after the check. \n\n7.8 Glossary \n\nreassignment: Assigning a new value to a variable that already exists. \n\n7.9. Exercises 69 \n\nupdate: An assignment where the new value of the variable depends on the old. \n\ninitialization: An assignment that gives an initial value to a variable that will be updated. \n\nincrement: An update that increases the value of a variable (often by one). \n\ndecrement: An update that decreases the value of a variable. \n\niteration: Repeated execution of a set of statements using either a recursive function call or a loop. \n\nin\ufb01nite loop: A loop in which the terminating condition is never satis\ufb01ed. \n\nalgorithm: A general process for solving a category of problems. \n\n7.9 Exercises \n\nExercise 7.1. Copy the loop from Section 7.5 and encapsulate it in a function called mysqrt that takes a as a parameter, chooses a reasonable value of x, and returns an estimate of the square root of a. \n\nTo test it, write a function named test_square_root that prints a table like this: \n\na mysqrt(a) math.sqrt(a) diff - --------- ------------ ---- 1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.41421356237 1.41421356237 2.22044604925e-16 3.0 1.73205080757 1.73205080757 0.0 4.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 5.0 2.2360679775 2.2360679775 0.0 6.0 2.44948974278 2.44948974278 0.0 7.0 2.64575131106 2.64575131106 0.0 8.0 2.82842712475 2.82842712475 4.4408920985e-16 9.0 3.0 3.0 0.0 \n\nThe \ufb01rst column is a number, a; the second column is the square root of a computed with mysqrt; the third column is the square root computed by math.sqrt; the fourth column is the absolute value of the difference between the two estimates. Exercise 7.2. The built-in function eval takes a string and evaluates it using the Python inter- preter. For example: \n\n>>> eval('1 + 2 * 3') 7 >>> import math >>> eval('math.sqrt(5)') 2.2360679774997898 >>> eval('type(math.pi)') <class 'float'> \n\nWrite a function called eval_loop that iteratively prompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates it using eval, and prints the result. \n\nIt should continue until the user enters 'done', and then return the value of the last expression it evaluated. \n\n70 Chapter 7. Iteration \n\nExercise 7.3. The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an in\ufb01nite series that can be used to generate a numerical approximation of 1/\u03c0: \n\n1 \u03c0 = 2 \u221a \n\n2 9801 \n\n\u221e \u2211 k=0 \n\n(4k)!(1103 + 26390k) \n\n(k!)43964k \n\nWrite a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and return an estimate of \u03c0. It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10\u221215). You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ pi. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n\n",
