  "content": "# word play\n\n\n\nThis chapter presents the second case study, which involves solving word puzzles by \nsearching for words that have certain properties. For example, we\u2019ll \ufb01nd the longest palin- \ndromes in English and search for words whose letters appear in alphabetical order. And \nI will present another program development plan: reduction to a previously solved prob- \nlem. \n\n9.1 \nReading word lists \n\nFor the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words. There are lots of word \nlists available on the Web, but the one most suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists \ncollected and contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby lexi- \ncon project (see http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project ). It is a list of 113,809 of\ufb01cial \ncrosswords; that is, words that are considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word \ngames. In the Moby collection, the \ufb01lename is 113809of.fic ; you can download a copy, \nwith the simpler name words.txt , from https://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt . \n\nThis \ufb01le is in plain text, so you can open it with a text editor, but you can also read it from \nPython. The built-in function open takes the name of the \ufb01le as a parameter and returns a \n\ufb01le object you can use to read the \ufb01le. \n\n>>> fin = open('words.txt') \n\nfin is a common name for a \ufb01le object used for input. The \ufb01le object provides several \nmethods for reading, including readline , which reads characters from the \ufb01le until it gets \nto a newline and returns the result as a string: \n\n>>> fin.readline() \n'aa\\n' \n\nThe \ufb01rst word in this particular list is \u201caa\u201d, which is a kind of lava. The sequence \\n \nrepresents the newline character that separates this word from the next. \n\nThe \ufb01le object keeps track of where it is in the \ufb01le, so if you call readline again, you get \nthe next word: \n\n>>> fin.readline() \n'aah\\n' \n\n84 \nChapter 9. Case study: word play \n\nThe next word is \u201caah\u201d, which is a perfectly legitimate word, so stop looking at me like \nthat. Or, if it\u2019s the newline character that\u2019s bothering you, we can get rid of it with the \nstring method strip : \n\n>>> line = fin.readline() \n>>> word = line.strip() \n>>> word \n'aahed' \n\nYou can also use a \ufb01le object as part of a for loop. This program reads words.txt and \nprints each word, one per line: \n\nfin = open('words.txt') \nfor line in fin: \nword = line.strip() \nprint(word) \n\n9.2 \nExercises \n\nThere are solutions to these exercises in the next section. You should at least attempt each \none before you read the solutions. \nExercise 9.1. Write a program that reads words.txt and prints only the words with more than 20 \ncharacters (not counting whitespace). \nExercise 9.2. In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby that \ndoes not contain the letter \u201ce\u201d. Since \u201ce\u201d is the most common letter in English, that\u2019s not easy to \ndo. \n\nIn fact, it is dif\ufb01cult to construct a solitary thought without using that most common symbol. It is \nslow going at \ufb01rst, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility. \n\nAll right, I\u2019ll stop now. \n\nWrite a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn\u2019t have the letter \u201ce\u201d in \nit. \n\nWrite a program that reads words.txt and prints only the words that have no \u201ce\u201d. Compute the \npercentage of words in the list that have no \u201ce\u201d. \nExercise 9.3. Write a function named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, \nand that returns True if the word doesn\u2019t use any of the forbidden letters. \n\nWrite a program that prompts the user to enter a string of forbidden letters and then prints the \nnumber of words that don\u2019t contain any of them. Can you \ufb01nd a combination of 5 forbidden letters \nthat excludes the smallest number of words? \nExercise 9.4. Write a function named uses_only that takes a word and a string of letters, and \nthat returns True if the word contains only letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only \nthe letters acefhlo ? Other than \u201cHoe alfalfa\u201d? \nExercise 9.5. Write a function named uses_all that takes a word and a string of required letters, \nand that returns True if the word uses all the required letters at least once. How many words are \nthere that use all the vowels aeiou ? How about aeiouy ? \nExercise 9.6. Write a function called is_abecedarian that returns True if the letters in a word \nappear in alphabetical order (double letters are ok). How many abecedarian words are there? \n\n9.3. Search \n85 \n\n9.3 \nSearch \n\nAll of the exercises in the previous section have something in common; they can be solved \nwith the search pattern we saw in Section 8.6. The simplest example is: \n\ndef has_no_e(word): \nfor letter in word: \nif letter == 'e': \nreturn False \nreturn True \n\nThe for loop traverses the characters in word . If we \ufb01nd the letter \u201ce\u201d, we can immediately \nreturn False ; otherwise we have to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that \nmeans we didn\u2019t \ufb01nd an \u201ce\u201d, so we return True . \n\nYou could write this function more concisely using the in operator, but I started with this \nversion because it demonstrates the logic of the search pattern. \n\navoids is a more general version of has_no_e but it has the same structure: \n\ndef avoids(word, forbidden): \nfor letter in word: \nif letter in forbidden: \nreturn False \nreturn True \n\nWe can return False as soon as we \ufb01nd a forbidden letter; if we get to the end of the loop, \nwe return True . \n\nuses_only is similar except that the sense of the condition is reversed: \n\ndef uses_only(word, available): \nfor letter in word: \nif letter not in available: \nreturn False \nreturn True \n\nInstead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available letters. If we \ufb01nd a letter in \nword that is not in available , we can return False . \n\nuses_all is similar except that we reverse the role of the word and the string of letters: \n\ndef uses_all(word, required): \nfor letter in required: \nif letter not in word: \nreturn False \nreturn True \n\nInstead of traversing the letters in word , the loop traverses the required letters. If any of the \nrequired letters do not appear in the word, we can return False . \n\nIf you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would have recognized that \nuses_all was an instance of a previously solved problem, and you would have written: \n\ndef uses_all(word, required): \nreturn uses_only(required, word) \n\nThis is an example of a program development plan called reduction to a previously solved \nproblem , which means that you recognize the problem you are working on as an instance \nof a solved problem and apply an existing solution. \n\n86 \nChapter 9. Case study: word play \n\n9.4 \nLooping with indices \n\nI wrote the functions in the previous section with for loops because I only needed the \ncharacters in the strings; I didn\u2019t have to do anything with the indices. \n\nFor is_abecedarian we have to compare adjacent letters, which is a little tricky with a for \nloop: \n\ndef is_abecedarian(word): \nprevious = word[0] \nfor c in word: \nif c < previous: \nreturn False \nprevious = c \nreturn True \n\nAn alternative is to use recursion: \n\ndef is_abecedarian(word): \nif len(word) <= 1: \nreturn True \nif word[0] > word[1]: \nreturn False \nreturn is_abecedarian(word[1:]) \n\nAnother option is to use a while loop: \n\ndef is_abecedarian(word): \ni = 0 \nwhile i < len(word)-1: \nif word[i+1] < word[i]: \nreturn False \ni = i+1 \nreturn True \n\nThe loop starts at i=0 and ends when i=len(word)-1 . Each time through the loop, it com- \npares the i th character (which you can think of as the current character) to the i + 1th \ncharacter (which you can think of as the next). \n\nIf the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current one, then we have dis- \ncovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and we return False . \n\nIf we get to the end of the loop without \ufb01nding a fault, then the word passes the test. To \nconvince yourself that the loop ends correctly, consider an example like 'flossy' . The \nlength of the word is 6, so the last time the loop runs is when i is 4, which is the index of \nthe second-to-last character. On the last iteration, it compares the second-to-last character \nto the last, which is what we want. \n\nHere is a version of is_palindrome (see Exercise 6.3) that uses two indices; one starts at \nthe beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down. \n\ndef is_palindrome(word): \ni = 0 \nj = len(word)-1 \n\nwhile i<j: \nif word[i] != word[j]: \n\n9.5. Debugging \n87 \n\nreturn False \ni = i+1 \nj = j-1 \n\nreturn True \n\nOr we could reduce to a previously solved problem and write: \n\ndef is_palindrome(word): \nreturn is_reverse(word, word) \n\nUsing is_reverse from Section 8.11. \n\n9.5 \nDebugging \n\nTesting programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are relatively easy to test because \nyou can check the results by hand. Even so, it is somewhere between dif\ufb01cult and impos- \nsible to choose a set of words that test for all possible errors. \n\nTaking has_no_e as an example, there are two obvious cases to check: words that have an \n\u2018e\u2019 should return False , and words that don\u2019t should return True . You should have no \ntrouble coming up with one of each. \n\nWithin each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the words that have an \n\u201ce\u201d, you should test words with an \u201ce\u201d at the beginning, the end, and somewhere in the \nmiddle. You should test long words, short words, and very short words, like the empty \nstring. The empty string is an example of a special case , which is one of the non-obvious \ncases where errors often lurk. \n\nIn addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test your program with a word list \nlike words.txt . By scanning the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful: \nyou might catch one kind of error (words that should not be included, but are) and not \nanother (words that should be included, but aren\u2019t). \n\nIn general, testing can help you \ufb01nd bugs, but it is not easy to generate a good set of \ntest cases, and even if you do, you can\u2019t be sure your program is correct. According to a \nlegendary computer scientist: \n\nProgram testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show \ntheir absence! \n\n\u2014 Edsger W. Dijkstra \n\n9.6 \nGlossary \n\n\ufb01le object: A value that represents an open \ufb01le. \n\nreduction to a previously solved problem: A way of solving a problem by expressing it \nas an instance of a previously solved problem. \n\nspecial case: A test case that is atypical or non-obvious (and less likely to be handled cor- \nrectly). \n\n88 \nChapter 9. Case study: word play \n\n9.7 \nExercises \n\nExercise 9.7. This question is based on a Puzzler that was broadcast on the radio program Car \nTalk ( http: // www. cartalk. com/ content/ puzzlers ): \n\nGive me a word with three consecutive double letters. I\u2019ll give you a couple of words \nthat almost qualify, but don\u2019t. For example, the word committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It \nwould be great except for the \u2018i\u2019 that sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i- \np-p-i. If you could take out those i\u2019s it would work. But there is a word that has three \nconsecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may be the only word. \nOf course there are probably 500 more but I can only think of one. What is the word? \n\nWrite a program to \ufb01nd it. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ cartalk1. py . \nExercise 9.8. Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler ( http: // www. cartalk. com/ content/ \npuzzlers ): \n\n\u201cI was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to notice my odometer. \nLike most odometers, it shows six digits, in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000 \nmiles, for example, I\u2019d see 3-0-0-0-0-0. \n\n\u201cNow, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the last 4 digits were \npalindromic; that is, they read the same forward as backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a \npalindrome, so my odometer could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5. \n\n\u201cOne mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it could have read \n3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of 6 numbers were palindromic. And \nyou ready for this? One mile later, all 6 were palindromic! \n\n\u201cThe question is, what was on the odometer when I \ufb01rst looked?\u201d \n\nWrite a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints any numbers that satisfy \nthese requirements. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ cartalk2. py . \nExercise 9.9. Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler you can solve with a search ( http: // www. \ncartalk. com/ content/ puzzlers ): \n\n\u201cRecently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that the two digits that make \nup my age when reversed resulted in her age. For example, if she\u2019s 73, I\u2019m 37. We \nwondered how often this has happened over the years but we got sidetracked with other \ntopics and we never came up with an answer. \n\n\u201cWhen I got home I \ufb01gured out that the digits of our ages have been reversible six times \nso far. I also \ufb01gured out that if we\u2019re lucky it would happen again in a few years, and \nif we\u2019re really lucky it would happen one more time after that. In other words, it would \nhave happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?\u201d \n\nWrite a Python program that searches for solutions to this Puzzler. Hint: you might \ufb01nd the string \nmethod zfill useful. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ cartalk3. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 10\n\n\n",
