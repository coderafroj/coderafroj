In this chapter you\u2019ll see how to access the characters \nthat make up a string, and you\u2019ll learn about some of the methods strings provide. \n\n8.1 \nA string is a sequence \n\nA string is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the \nbracket operator: \n\n>>> fruit = 'banana' \n>>> letter = fruit[1] \n\nThe second statement selects character number 1 from fruit and assigns it to letter . \n\nThe expression in brackets is called an index . The index indicates which character in the \nsequence you want (hence the name). \n\nBut you might not get what you expect: \n\n>>> letter \n'a' \n\nFor most people, the \ufb01rst letter of 'banana' is b , not a . But for computer scientists, the \nindex is an offset from the beginning of the string, and the offset of the \ufb01rst letter is zero. \n\n>>> letter = fruit[0] \n>>> letter \n'b' \n\nSo b is the 0th letter (\u201czero-eth\u201d) of 'banana' , a is the 1th letter (\u201cone-eth\u201d), and n is the 2th \nletter (\u201ctwo-eth\u201d). \n\nAs an index you can use an expression that contains variables and operators: \n\n>>> i = 1 \n>>> fruit[i] \n'a' \n>>> fruit[i+1] \n'n' \n\n72 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\nBut the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you get: \n\n>>> letter = fruit[1.5] \nTypeError: string indices must be integers \n\n8.2 \nlen \n\nlen is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string: \n\n>>> fruit = 'banana' \n>>> len(fruit) \n6 \n\nTo get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something like this: \n\n>>> length = len(fruit) \n>>> last = fruit[length] \nIndexError: string index out of range \n\nThe reason for the IndexError is that there is no letter in \u2019banana\u2019 with the index 6. Since \nwe started counting at zero, the six letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, \nyou have to subtract 1 from length : \n\n>>> last = fruit[length-1] \n>>> last \n'a' \n\nOr you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The \nexpression fruit[-1] yields the last letter, fruit[-2] yields the second to last, and so on. \n\n8.3 \nTraversal with a for loop \n\nA lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a time. Often they start \nat the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the \nend. This pattern of processing is called a traversal . One way to write a traversal is with a \nwhile loop: \n\nindex = 0 \nwhile index < len(fruit): \nletter = fruit[index] \nprint(letter) \nindex = index + 1 \n\nThis loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by itself. The loop condition \nis index < len(fruit) , so when index is equal to the length of the string, the condition is \nfalse, and the body of the loop doesn\u2019t run. The last character accessed is the one with the \nindex len(fruit)-1 , which is the last character in the string. \n\nAs an exercise, write a function that takes a string as an argument and displays the letters \nbackward, one per line. \n\nAnother way to write a traversal is with a for loop: \n\nfor letter in fruit: \nprint(letter) \n\n8.4. String slices \n73 \n\nfruit \n\n### b a n\n\n\n### n\n\n\n### a\n\n\n### a \u2019\n\n\n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \nindex \n\n### \u2019\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Slice indices. \n\nEach time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned to the variable \nletter . The loop continues until no characters are left. \n\nThe following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition) and a for loop \nto generate an abecedarian series (that is, in alphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey\u2019s \nbook Make Way for Ducklings , the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, \nOuack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in order: \n\nprefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ' \nsuffix = 'ack' \n\nfor letter in prefixes: \nprint(letter + suffix) \n\nThe output is: \n\nJack \nKack \nLack \nMack \nNack \nOack \nPack \nQack \n\nOf course, that\u2019s not quite right because \u201cOuack\u201d and \u201cQuack\u201d are misspelled. As an \nexercise, modify the program to \ufb01x this error. \n\n8.4 \nString slices \n\nA segment of a string is called a slice . Selecting a slice is similar to selecting a character: \n\n>>> s = 'Monty Python' \n>>> s[0:5] \n'Monty' \n>>> s[6:12] \n'Python' \n\nThe operator [n:m] returns the part of the string from the \u201cn-eth\u201d character to the \u201cm-eth\u201d \ncharacter, including the \ufb01rst but excluding the last. This behavior is counterintuitive, but \nit might help to imagine the indices pointing between the characters, as in Figure 8.1. \n\nIf you omit the \ufb01rst index (before the colon), the slice starts at the beginning of the string. \nIf you omit the second index, the slice goes to the end of the string: \n\n>>> fruit = 'banana' \n>>> fruit[:3] \n\n74 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\n'ban' \n>>> fruit[3:] \n'ana' \n\nIf the \ufb01rst index is greater than or equal to the second the result is an empty string , repre- \nsented by two quotation marks: \n\n>>> fruit = 'banana' \n>>> fruit[3:3] \n'' \n\nAn empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other than that, it is the same \nas any other string. \n\nContinuing this example, what do you think fruit[:] means? Try it and see. \n\n8.5 \nStrings are immutable \n\nIt is tempting to use the [] operator on the left side of an assignment, with the intention of \nchanging a character in a string. For example: \n\n>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!' \n>>> greeting[0] = 'J' \nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment \n\nThe \u201cobject\u201d in this case is the string and the \u201citem\u201d is the character you tried to assign. \nFor now, an object is the same thing as a value, but we will re\ufb01ne that de\ufb01nition later \n(Section 10.10). \n\nThe reason for the error is that strings are immutable , which means you can\u2019t change an \nexisting string. The best you can do is create a new string that is a variation on the original: \n\n>>> greeting = 'Hello, world!' \n>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:] \n>>> new_greeting \n'Jello, world!' \n\nThis example concatenates a new \ufb01rst letter onto a slice of greeting . It has no effect on the \noriginal string. \n\n8.6 \nSearching \n\nWhat does the following function do? \n\ndef find(word, letter): \nindex = 0 \nwhile index < len(word): \nif word[index] == letter: \nreturn index \nindex = index + 1 \nreturn -1 \n\n8.7. Looping and counting \n75 \n\nIn a sense, find is the inverse of the [] operator. Instead of taking an index and extracting \nthe corresponding character, it takes a character and \ufb01nds the index where that character \nappears. If the character is not found, the function returns -1 . \n\nThis is the \ufb01rst example we have seen of a return statement inside a loop. If word[index] \n== letter , the function breaks out of the loop and returns immediately. \n\nIf the character doesn\u2019t appear in the string, the program exits the loop normally and re- \nturns -1 . \n\nThis pattern of computation\u2014traversing a sequence and returning when we \ufb01nd what we \nare looking for\u2014is called a search . \n\nAs an exercise, modify find so that it has a third parameter, the index in word where it \nshould start looking. \n\n8.7 \nLooping and counting \n\nThe following program counts the number of times the letter a appears in a string: \n\nword = 'banana' \ncount = 0 \nfor letter in word: \nif letter == 'a': \ncount = count + 1 \nprint(count) \n\nThis program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a counter . The variable \ncount is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time an a is found. When the loop exits, \ncount contains the result\u2014the total number of a \u2019s. \n\nAs an exercise, encapsulate this code in a function named count , and generalize it so that \nit accepts the string and the letter as arguments. \n\nThen rewrite the function so that instead of traversing the string, it uses the three- \nparameter version of find from the previous section. \n\n8.8 \nString methods \n\nStrings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations. A method is similar \nto a function\u2014it takes arguments and returns a value\u2014but the syntax is different. For \nexample, the method upper takes a string and returns a new string with all uppercase \nletters. \n\nInstead of the function syntax upper(word) , it uses the method syntax word.upper() . \n\n>>> word = 'banana' \n>>> new_word = word.upper() \n>>> new_word \n'BANANA' \n\n76 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\nThis form of dot notation speci\ufb01es the name of the method, upper , and the name of the \nstring to apply the method to, word . The empty parentheses indicate that this method \ntakes no arguments. \n\nA method call is called an invocation ; in this case, we would say that we are invoking \nupper on word . \n\nAs it turns out, there is a string method named find that is remarkably similar to the \nfunction we wrote: \n\n>>> word = 'banana' \n>>> index = word.find('a') \n>>> index \n1 \n\nIn this example, we invoke find on word and pass the letter we are looking for as a param- \neter. \n\nActually, the find method is more general than our function; it can \ufb01nd substrings, not just \ncharacters: \n\n>>> word.find('na') \n2 \n\nBy default, find starts at the beginning of the string, but it can take a second argument, the \nindex where it should start: \n\n>>> word.find('na', 3) \n4 \n\nThis is an example of an optional argument ; find can also take a third argument, the index \nwhere it should stop: \n\n>>> name = 'bob' \n>>> name.find('b', 1, 2) \n-1 \n\nThis search fails because b does not appear in the index range from 1 to 2 , not including 2 . \nSearching up to, but not including, the second index makes find consistent with the slice \noperator. \n\n8.9 \nThe in operator \n\nThe word in is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns True if the \ufb01rst ap- \npears as a substring in the second: \n\n>>> 'a' in 'banana' \nTrue \n>>> 'seed' in 'banana' \nFalse \n\nFor example, the following function prints all the letters from word1 that also appear in \nword2 : \n\ndef in_both(word1, word2): \nfor letter in word1: \nif letter in word2: \nprint(letter) \n\n8.10. String comparison \n77 \n\nWith well-chosen variable names, Python sometimes reads like English. You could read \nthis loop, \u201cfor (each) letter in (the \ufb01rst) word, if (the) letter (appears) in (the second) word, \nprint (the) letter.\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s what you get if you compare apples and oranges: \n\n>>> in_both('apples', 'oranges') \na \ne \ns \n\n8.10 \nString comparison \n\nThe relational operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal: \n\nif word == 'banana': \nprint('All right, bananas.') \n\nOther relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical order: \n\nif word < 'banana': \nprint('Your word, ' + word + ', comes before banana.') \nelif word > 'banana': \nprint('Your word, ' + word + ', comes after banana.') \nelse: \nprint('All right, bananas.') \n\nPython does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way people do. All the \nuppercase letters come before all the lowercase letters, so: \n\nYour word, Pineapple, comes before banana. \n\nA common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a standard format, such as \nall lowercase, before performing the comparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to \ndefend yourself against a man armed with a Pineapple. \n\n8.11 \nDebugging \n\nWhen you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence, it is tricky to get the beginning \nand end of the traversal right. Here is a function that is supposed to compare two words \nand return True if one of the words is the reverse of the other, but it contains two errors: \n\ndef is_reverse(word1, word2): \nif len(word1) != len(word2): \nreturn False \n\ni = 0 \nj = len(word2) \n\nwhile j > 0: \nif word1[i] != word2[j]: \nreturn False \ni = i+1 \n\n78 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\nj = j-1 \n\nreturn True \nThe \ufb01rst if statement checks whether the words are the same length. If not, we can return \nFalse immediately. Otherwise, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words \nare the same length. This is an example of the guardian pattern in Section 6.8. \n\ni and j are indices: i traverses word1 forward while j traverses word2 backward. If we \n\ufb01nd two letters that don\u2019t match, we can return False immediately. If we get through the \nwhole loop and all the letters match, we return True . \n\nIf we test this function with the words \u201cpots\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d, we expect the return value True , \nbut we get an IndexError: \n>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop') \n... \nFile \"reverse.py\", line 15, in is_reverse \nif word1[i] != word2[j]: \nIndexError: string index out of range \nFor debugging this kind of error, my \ufb01rst move is to print the values of the indices imme- \ndiately before the line where the error appears. \nwhile j > 0: \nprint(i, j) \n# print here \n\nif word1[i] != word2[j]: \nreturn False \ni = i+1 \nj = j-1 \nNow when I run the program again, I get more information: \n>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop') \n0 4 \n... \nIndexError: string index out of range \nThe \ufb01rst time through the loop, the value of j is 4, which is out of range for the \nstring 'pots' . The index of the last character is 3, so the initial value for j should be \nlen(word2)-1 . \n\nIf I \ufb01x that error and run the program again, I get: \n>>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop') \n0 3 \n1 2 \n2 1 \nTrue \nThis time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran three times, which is \nsuspicious. To get a better idea of what is happening, it is useful to draw a state diagram. \nDuring the \ufb01rst iteration, the frame for is_reverse is shown in Figure 8.2. \n\nI took some license by arranging the variables in the frame and adding dotted lines to show \nthat the values of i and j indicate characters in word1 and word2 . \n\nStarting with this diagram, run the program on paper, changing the values of i and j \nduring each iteration. Find and \ufb01x the second error in this function. \n\n8.12.

For now, you can use \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d \ninterchangeably. \n\nsequence: An ordered collection of values where each value is identi\ufb01ed by an integer \nindex. \n\nitem: One of the values in a sequence. \n\nindex: An integer value used to select an item in a sequence, such as a character in a string. \nIn Python indices start from 0. \n\nslice: A part of a string speci\ufb01ed by a range of indices. \n\nempty string: A string with no characters and length 0, represented by two quotation \nmarks. \n\nimmutable: The property of a sequence whose items cannot be changed. \n\ntraverse: To iterate through the items in a sequence, performing a similar operation on \neach. \n\nsearch: A pattern of traversal that stops when it \ufb01nds what it is looking for. \n\ncounter: A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and then incre- \nmented. \n\ninvocation: A statement that calls a method. \n\noptional argument: A function or method argument that is not required. \n\n8.13 \nExercises \n\nExercise 8.1. Read the documentation of the string methods at http: // docs. python. org/ 3/ \nlibrary/ stdtypes. html# string-methods . You might want to experiment with some of them \nto make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful. \n\nThe \ndocumentation \nuses \na \nsyntax \nthat \nmight \nbe \nconfusing. \nFor \nexample, \nin \nfind(sub[, start[, end]]) , the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but \nstart is optional, and if you include start , then end is optional. \nExercise 8.2. There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in Section 8.7. \nRead the documentation of this method and write an invocation that counts the number of a \u2019s in \n'banana' . \nExercise 8.3. A string slice can take a third index that speci\ufb01es the \u201cstep size\u201d; that is, the number \nof spaces between successive characters. A step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every \nthird, etc. \n\n80 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\n>>> fruit = 'banana' \n>>> fruit[0:5:2] \n'bnn' \n\nA step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so the slice [::-1] generates a reversed string. \n\nUse this idiom to write a one-line version of is_palindrome from Exercise 6.3. \nExercise 8.4. The following functions are all intended to check whether a string contains any \nlowercase letters, but at least some of them are wrong. For each function, describe what the function \nactually does (assuming that the parameter is a string). \n\ndef any_lowercase1(s): \nfor c in s: \nif c.islower(): \nreturn True \nelse: \nreturn False \n\ndef any_lowercase2(s): \nfor c in s: \nif 'c'.islower(): \nreturn 'True' \nelse: \nreturn 'False' \n\ndef any_lowercase3(s): \nfor c in s: \nflag = c.islower() \nreturn flag \n\ndef any_lowercase4(s): \nflag = False \nfor c in s: \nflag = flag or c.islower() \nreturn flag \n\ndef any_lowercase5(s): \nfor c in s: \nif not c.islower(): \nreturn False \nreturn True \nExercise 8.5. A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves \u201crotating\u201d each letter by \na \ufb01xed number of places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around \nto the beginning if necessary, so \u2019A\u2019 rotated by 3 is \u2019D\u2019 and \u2019Z\u2019 rotated by 1 is \u2019A\u2019. \n\nTo rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount. For example, \u201ccheer\u201d rotated by 7 is \u201cjolly\u201d \nand \u201cmelon\u201d rotated by -10 is \u201ccubed\u201d. In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey , the ship computer \nis called HAL, which is IBM rotated by -1. \n\nWrite a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns \na new string that contains the letters from the original string rotated by the given amount. \n\nYou might want to use the built-in function ord , which converts a character to a numeric code, and \n\n8.13. Exercises \n81 \n\nchr , which converts numeric codes to characters. Letters of the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical \norder, so for example: \n\n>>> ord('c') - ord('a') \n2 \n\nBecause 'c' is the two-eth letter of the alphabet. But beware: the numeric codes for upper case \nletters are different. \n\nPotentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded in ROT13, which is a Caesar \ncypher with rotation 13. If you are not easily offended, \ufb01nd and decode some of them. Solution: \nhttps: // thinkpython. com/ code/ rotate. py . \n\n82 \nChapter 8. Strings \n\n\n## Chapter 9\n\n\n",
