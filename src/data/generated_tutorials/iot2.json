In this book, the author takes the \nreaders through all the important design and implementation details of various functions \npossible with IoT. For instance, the first chapter of the book introduces the concept of \na smart umbrella which can, using specific sensors and computational devices and \nconnectivity to the Internet, share weather updates with its users. A chapter on smart cars \nor connected cars elucidates how such cars can perform automatic detection of service \nrequirements by direct transfer of service-relevant data to the car maintenance and service \ncenter or to the driver/car user server, and also send automatic reminders of servicing \nappointments, thereby lessening service visits. \n\nIoT is now widely researched and being rapidly implemented as well. A TCS study, \n\u2018Internet of Things: The Complete Re-Imaginative Force\u2019, 2015, quotes technology \nresearcher Gartner Projection as, \n\n\u2018There will be 4.9 billion \u2018connected things\u2019 (or \u2018smart-connected products\u2019, as Harvard \nBusiness School Professor Michael Porter refers to them) this year, and we haven\u2019t seen \nanything yet. The number is predicted to grow five times by the end of the decade, to 25 billion \n\nvi \nPreface \n\nconnected things, including a quarter billion vehicles. Gartner says, by 2020, a quarter billion \nconnected vehicles will enable new in-vehicle services and automated driving capabilities.\u2019 1 \n\nTarget Audience \n\nInternet of Things design and IoT products, services and applications development need \na team of hardware as well as software professionals. These professionals in turn need a \nreserve to make them aware of latest in this field. Thus, this book would suffice the needs \nof these individuals and also of undergraduate and postgraduate students of engineering, \ncomputer science and information technology. \n\nAbout the Book \n\nThe book has been written in an easy-to-understand and student-friendly manner, and \nincludes several illustrative figures and examples, sample codes and project case studies. \nThe text explains architecture, design principles, hardware and software designs, while \nkeeping multidisciplinary under-graduates and post-graduates in mind as primary \nreaders. Each chapter begins by defining the learning objectives for each section, recall \nfrom previous chapters, introduction and the important terms covered in that chapter. \nEnd of each section enlists the points understood and provides self-assessment questions, \nclassified as per three difficulty levels. Additionally, key concepts, learning outcomes, \nobjective questions, short-answer questions, review questions and practice exercises are \nprovided to revise and apply concepts learned from the chapter. \n\nLearning and Assessment Tools \n\nLearning Objectives \n\nLearning Objectives (LO) have been drafted for content in this book. This is an educational \nprocess that emphasizes on developing required skills amongst students and tests the \noutcomes of the study of a course, as opposed to routine learning. This approach creates \nan ability to acquire knowledge and apply fundamental principles to analytical problems \nand applications. \n\nSelf-assessment Exercises \n\nEach learning objective is followed by a set of questions for self-assessment of students. \nThis offers great retention through looping mechanism. \n\nPedagogical Classification \n\nThe pedagogy is arranged as per levels of difficulty. All checkpoint problems are linked \nwith Learning Objectives (LOs) and marked with Levels of Difficulty (LOD), to help assess \n\n1 http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2970017 (January 2015). \n\nPreface \nvii \n\nthe student\u2019s learning. This assessment of levels of difficulty is derived as per Bloom\u2019s \nTaxonomy. \n\n\u2605 \nIndicates Level 1 and Level 2, i.e. knowledge and comprehension based easy-to- \nsolve problems. \n\n\u2605\u2605 \nIndicates Level 3 and Level 4, i.e. application and analysis based medium-to- \ndifficult problems. \n\u2605\u2605\u2605 \nIndicates Level 5 and Level 6, i.e. synthesis and evaluation based very difficult \nproblems. \n\nLearning Outcomes \n\nSummary points specific to each LO are provided at the end of each chapter. It helps in \nrecapitulating the ideas initiated with the outcomes achieved. \n\nChapter-end Exercises \n\nMore than 500 carefully designed chapter-end exercises are arranged as per levels of \ndifficulty and are constructed to enhance knowledge and test technical skills. These include \nobjective questions, short-answer questions, review problems and practice problems. \n\nSalient Features \n\n\u25cf New IoT/M2M architecture, reference models, standards and protocols covered in \ndetail \n\n\u25cf Latest topics such as Industrial IoT , Industry 4.0 , Participative Sensing , Connected Car \nform a part of this edition \n\n\u25cf Explains architecture, design principles, hardware and software designs and \napplications/services/processes \n\n\u25cf Additional online material for students and instructors shared via web resources. \n\n\u25cf Rich pedagogy \n\n\u274d Illustrations: 101 \n\n\u274d Solved examples: 88 \n\n\u274d Case studies: 4 \n\n\u274d Self-assessment questions: 422 \n\n\u274d Objective questions: 133 \n\n\u274d Short-answer questions: 172 \n\n\u274d Review questions: 129 \n\n\u274d Practice questions: 118 \n\nChapter Organisation \n\nChapter 1 gives an overview of \u2018Internet of Things\u2019.
