In this book, the author takes the readers through all the important design and implementation details of various functions possible with IoT. For instance, the first chapter of the book introduces the concept of a smart umbrella which can, using specific sensors and computational devices and connectivity to the Internet, share weather updates with its users. A chapter on smart cars or connected cars elucidates how such cars can perform automatic detection of service requirements by direct transfer of service-relevant data to the car maintenance and service center or to the driver/car user server, and also send automatic reminders of servicing appointments, thereby lessening service visits. \n\nIoT is now widely researched and being rapidly implemented as well. A TCS study, \u2018Internet of Things: The Complete Re-Imaginative Force\u2019, 2015, quotes technology researcher Gartner Projection as, \n\n\u2018There will be 4.9 billion \u2018connected things\u2019 (or \u2018smart-connected products\u2019, as Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter refers to them) this year, and we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. The number is predicted to grow five times by the end of the decade, to 25 billion \n\nvi Preface \n\nconnected things, including a quarter billion vehicles. Gartner says, by 2020, a quarter billion connected vehicles will enable new in-vehicle services and automated driving capabilities.\u20191 \n\nTarget Audience \n\nInternet of Things design and IoT products, services and applications development need a team of hardware as well as software professionals. These professionals in turn need a reserve to make them aware of latest in this field. Thus, this book would suffice the needs of these individuals and also of undergraduate and postgraduate students of engineering, computer science and information technology. \n\nAbout the Book \n\nThe book has been written in an easy-to-understand and student-friendly manner, and includes several illustrative figures and examples, sample codes and project case studies. The text explains architecture, design principles, hardware and software designs, while keeping multidisciplinary under-graduates and post-graduates in mind as primary readers. Each chapter begins by defining the learning objectives for each section, recall from previous chapters, introduction and the important terms covered in that chapter. End of each section enlists the points understood and provides self-assessment questions, classified as per three difficulty levels. Additionally, key concepts, learning outcomes, objective questions, short-answer questions, review questions and practice exercises are provided to revise and apply concepts learned from the chapter. \n\nLearning and Assessment Tools \n\nLearning Objectives \n\nLearning Objectives (LO) have been drafted for content in this book. This is an educational process that emphasizes on developing required skills amongst students and tests the outcomes of the study of a course, as opposed to routine learning. This approach creates an ability to acquire knowledge and apply fundamental principles to analytical problems and applications. \n\nSelf-assessment Exercises \n\nEach learning objective is followed by a set of questions for self-assessment of students. This offers great retention through looping mechanism. \n\nPedagogical Classification \n\nThe pedagogy is arranged as per levels of difficulty. All checkpoint problems are linked with Learning Objectives (LOs) and marked with Levels of Difficulty (LOD), to help assess \n\n1http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2970017 (January 2015). \n\nPreface vii \n\nthe student\u2019s learning. This assessment of levels of difficulty is derived as per Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy. \u2605 Indicates Level 1 and Level 2, i.e. knowledge and comprehension based easy-to- solve problems. \u2605\u2605 Indicates Level 3 and Level 4, i.e. application and analysis based medium-to- difficult problems. \u2605\u2605\u2605 Indicates Level 5 and Level 6, i.e. synthesis and evaluation based very difficult problems. \n\nLearning Outcomes \n\nSummary points specific to each LO are provided at the end of each chapter. It helps in recapitulating the ideas initiated with the outcomes achieved. \n\nChapter-end Exercises \n\nMore than 500 carefully designed chapter-end exercises are arranged as per levels of difficulty and are constructed to enhance knowledge and test technical skills. These include objective questions, short-answer questions, review problems and practice problems. \n\nSalient Features \n\n\u25cfNew IoT/M2M architecture, reference models, standards and protocols covered in detail \n\n\u25cfLatest topics such as Industrial IoT, Industry 4.0, Participative Sensing, Connected Car form a part of this edition \n\n\u25cfExplains architecture, design principles, hardware and software designs and applications/services/processes \n\n\u25cfAdditional online material for students and instructors shared via web resources. \n\n\u25cfRich pedagogy \n\n\u274dIllustrations: 101 \n\n\u274dSolved examples: 88 \n\n\u274dCase studies: 4 \n\n\u274dSelf-assessment questions: 422 \n\n\u274dObjective questions: 133 \n\n\u274dShort-answer questions: 172 \n\n\u274dReview questions: 129 \n\n\u274dPractice questions: 118 \n\nChapter Organisation \n\nChapter 1 gives an overview of \u2018Internet of Things\u2019.
