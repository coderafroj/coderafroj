Connected devices refer to devices such as streetlights, RFIDs, ATMs and automobiles, which are connected to the internet for applications, services and processes. \n\nSection 1.2 described reference Equations 1.1 to 1.3. The section also described conceptual main entities framework, reference model and reference architecture for IoT and M2M. Framework refers to a set of entities or software components which make provisions for generic functionalities. These functionalities can be selectively changed by user codes for developing an application. Conceptual framework means an abstraction of a framework. Reference model means main entities conceptualised and the relationships between them. Reference architecture means conceptualisation of main entities in a system, their functioning and deployment in the system and the processes rendered by the system. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 37 \n\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nWhen a letter is written then it is written according to a protocol (etiquette). To send a letter, it is first put in an envelope, and then the envelope is marked with the receiver\u2019s address at the centre, sender\u2019s address at left hand bottom area, stamp(s) is/are affixed at right hand top corner and the type of post is mentioned on top line in the centre. All letters are then gathered (stacked) and the stack is sent to the target city. Each action takes place according to a specified protocol at each stage (layer). Similarly, when data is transferred from a sensor, then functional units create a stack for data communication to an application or service. \n\nIoT or M2M device data refers to the data meant for communication to an application, service or process. Data also refers to data received by a device for its monitoring or for actions at actuator in it. \n\nData stack denotes the data received after the actions at various in-between layers (or levels or domains). Layers in Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model are Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data-link and Physical. \n\nActions at the data-adaptation or other layers can be related to data privacy, data security, data consolidation, aggregation, compaction and fusion. An action can be a gateway action\u2014using one protocol for reception and another one for transmission. \n\nFigures 1.3 to 1.5 showed that a connected device network communicates with the application server or data centre and cloud service. The applications, services and processes run using the server(s) data, notifications, alerts or messages. The data from the devices is gathered, enriched and streamed using communication and processing units. \n\nOracle reference architecture (Figure 1.5) based on Equation 1.2, showed that the things communicate with the managing, acquiring, organising and analysing units at the Internet. These enable running the applications and the processes. \n\nThe IBM conceptual framework, shown in Figure 1.3, consists of two sub-frameworks. The data from the devices gather, enrich and stream using communication and processing units. \n\nApplications and processes in IoT need that the things communicate with the managing, acquiring, organising and analysing units at the Internet (Equation 1.2). Examples of things are the sensors, machines, devices, controllers and intelligent edge nodes of different types. \n\nFigure 1.4 showed seven levels in IoT reference model. CISCO designed model has devices and other objects at the lowest level 1. The device data communication and processing units are at next level 2. The communication and processing enable the interconnection of devices to the Internet when a system manages, acquires, organises and analyses at higher layers at levels 3 to 7. \n\nFigure 1.9 showed three domains\u2014devices and communication, network, and applications in an M2M architecture. Figure 1.11 gave an architectural view of cloud-based IoT platform for a smart home. The figure showed three frameworks for a smart-home things system; cloud, VPN and video network; and service provider infrastructure. Figure 1.12 showed a four-layer architectural framework which has been developed at CISCO for a smart city. \n\n38 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nThe actions at a layer can be adding additional header after appropriate data formatting or transformation at functional units. For example, data from a device can be used by an application or in-between layers when a header (specifying device ID or address, destination addresses and other fields) adds and encrypts at the physical (device) layer for its security on the network. \n\nActions besides appending a header can be of appending the additional bits at the various in-between units. For example, appending additional message(s) or an acknowledgement. \n\nFollowing are the key terms which need to be understood to learn the design principles of connected devices for IoTs: \n\nLayer refers to a stage during a set of actions at which the action is taken as per a specific protocol or method, and then the result passes to the next layer until the set of actions complete. A layer may consist of various sublayers. \n\nPhysical layer refers to a layer at transmitting-node or at the receiving node for the data bits. The transfer uses physical systems and refers to wireless or wired transmission. This layer is the lowest layer. \n\nApplication layer refers to a layer for transmitting or receiving the data bits of an application. Data bits route across the network and transfer takes place as follows: application data from the application layer transfers after passing through several in-between layers to the physical layer, and from there it transmits to the receiving-end physical layer. Then, the data at the receiving node transfers from the physical layer to the application layer after passing through several in-between layers. \n\nLevel refers to a stage from the lowest to the highest. For example, acquiring device data and actions that may be considered at the lowest level and actions in business processes at the highest level. \n\nDomain refers to a set of software, layers or levels having specific applications and capabilities. For example, CoRE network, access network, service capabilities and applications can be considered as one domain, say, network domain. A domain generally has limited interactions with other domains or outside the domain. \n\nGateway refers to software for connecting two application layers, one at the sender and the  other at the receiver [application layer gateway (ALG)]. A gateway may be of different types. A communication gateway at device and gateway domain has capabilities as protocol-conversion during communication between two ends when each end uses distinct protocols. An Internet gateway may have capabilities besides protocol conversion, transcoding data, device management and data-enrichment before the data communicate over the Internet. Dictionary meaning of gateway is a place you go through because it leads to a much larger place (Section 2.4). \n\nIP stands for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) or Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) for the network layer (v6 means version 6, v4 version 4). \n\nHeader means a set of octets containing information about the data being sent. Header packs the data of a layer before transmission to the next layer during communication \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 39 \n\nbetween two end-points. The size of a header and its fields are according to the protocol used for creating data stack at a layer. For example, IPv4 header has fields as per IP network layer, Universal Datagram Protocol (UDP) header as per UDP at the transport layer and so on. Each header field has distinct meanings. The field size can be between 1 and 32-bit in a packet. A field helps in processing the packet when transferring it from one layer to the next one. \n\nPacket means packaged data-stack which routes over the network. Packet size limit is according to the protocol. For example, IPv4 packet size limit is 216 B (214 words with 1 word = 4 octet). \n\nProtocol Data Unit (PDU) is a unit of data which is specified in a protocol of a given layer which transfers from one layer to another. For example, PDU is bit which transfers from physical layer; frame from data-link layer; packet from network layer; segment from transport layer and text (plain, encrypted or compressed) from application and other layers. \n\nMaximum Transmission Unit (MTU) is the largest size frame or packet or segment specified in octets (1 octet = 1 byte = 8 bits) that can be sent in a packet or frame-based network such as the Internet. For example, consider transfers of a segment from the transport layer using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to the network layer. The MTU determines the maximum size of each data stack in any transfer to the network layer. The network layer determines the maximum size of each frame in any transfer to the data-link layer and then uses MTU of the data-link layer. \n\nStar network denotes the number of nodes interacting with a coordinator or master node. \n\nMesh network denotes the number of nodes that may interconnect with each other. \n\nEnd-point device or node denotes the one that provides connectivity to a coordinator or router. \n\nCoordinator denotes the one that connects to a number of end-points as well as routers in a star topology and forwards the data stack from one attached end point/router to another. \n\nMaster refers to the one who initiates the pairing with the devices in a star topology network. \n\nSlave means one that pairs with a master, uses the clock signals from master for synchronisation and uses address assigned by the master at the beginning. \n\nRouter refers to a device or node capable of storing paths to each destination to which it has logical links. The router sends the data stack according to the available path or paths at a receiving instance. \n\nISM band means Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) radio frequency (RF) bands. 2.4 GHz and the frequencies are 915 MHz for North America, 868 MHz for Europe and 433 MHz band for Asia in ISM bands. \n\nApplication means software for specific tasks, such as streetlight monitoring or control. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p66_i0.png)\n\n40 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nService means service software, for example, report generation or chart visualisation service. \n\nProcess means a software component, which processes the input and generates the output; for example after analysing the data or acquiring the data. An operating system controls a process, memory for the process and other parameters of the process. \n\nSuggested models, conceptual frameworks, reference models and architectures for the IoT/M2M suggest the following: \n\n\u25cfNeed of designing a communication framework for connecting devices, for their local area networking and provisions for data gathering. \n\n\u25cfNeed of designing a data enrichment, data consolidation and data transformation framework. \n\n\u25cfNeed of designing gateway components for connecting the device\u2019s network with the web/Internet. \n\n\u25cfNeed of application and applications-support frameworks for services, applications and processes. This chapter describes the physical cum data-link and data-adaptation layers, which communicate with the network layer. This chapter also describes communication frameworks for connecting devices, local area networks and applications. Subsequent chapters will describe the gateway components for connecting device networks with the web/Internet, application and application-support frameworks. \n\nFollowing sections describe design principles for connected devices. They describe standardised layers in an IoT system, communication frameworks, and wireless and wired technologies for connectivity framework in the devices and network domain. Following sections also describe the frameworks for communication, data management and data enrichment. \n\n2.2 IoT/M2M SYSTEMS, LAYERS AND DESIGNS STANDARDISATION \n\nA number of international organisations have taken action for IoT design standardisation. Following are the examples: \n\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an international body initiated actions for addressing and working on the recommendations for the engineering specifications for the Internet of Things. IETF suggests the specifications for the layers, and the engineering aspects for the IoT communication, networks and applications. \n\nInternational Telecommunication Union for Telecommunication (ITU-T) suggested a reference model for IoT domain, network and transport capabilities for the IoT services and the applications at the application and application-support layers. \n\nEuropean Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) initiated the development of a set of standards for the network, and devices and gateway domains for the communication \n\nSummarise recent initiatives \n\nof international organisations for design \n\nstandardisation of IoT/ \n\nM2M architectural layers and domains \n\nLO 2.1 \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 41 \n\nbetween machines (M2M). ETSI proposed high-level architecture for applications and service capabilities. \n\nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC), an International Industry Consortium, has also suggested open standards for sensors\u2019 discovery, capabilities, quality and other aspects with support to geographical information web support.1, 2 \n\nFollowing subsections describe these standardisation efforts. \n\n2.2.1 Modified OSI Model for the IoT/M2M Systems \n\nOSI protocols mean a family of information exchange standards developed jointly by the ISO and the ITU-T. The seven-layer OSI model is a standard model. It gives the basic outline for designing a communication network. Various models for data interchanges consider the layers specified by the OSI model, and modify it for simplicity according to the requirement. Similarly, IETF suggests modifications in the OSI model for the IoT/M2M. \n\nFigure 2.1 shows a classical seven-layer OSI model (on the left) and the modifications in that model proposed by IETF (in the middle). Data communicates from device end to application end. Each layer processes the received data and creates a new data stack which transfers it to the next layer. The processing takes place at the in-between layers, i.e. between the bottom functional-layer to the top layer. Device end also receives data from an application/service after processing at the in-between layers. Figure 2.1 also shows a similarity with the conceptual framework in Equation 1.2: \n\nGather + Enrich + Stream + (Manage + Acquire + Organise +Analyse) = IoT Applications and Services \n\nLayer 7 - Application Application = IoT Applications and Services \n\n+ Manage + Acquire + Organise and \n\nAnalyse \n\n+ Stream \n\n+ Enrich \n\nGather \n\nApplication-Support \n\nTransport \n\nNetwork \n\nData Adaption \n\nPhysical cum Data-link Layer \n\nLayer 6 - Presentation \n\nLayer 5 - Session \n\nLayer 4 - Transport \n\nLayer 3 - Network \n\nLayer 2 - Data-link \n\nLayer 1 - Physical \n\nFigure 2.1  Seven-layer generalised OSI model (on left) and IETF six layer modified OSI model for IoT/ \n\nM2M (in the middle), and similarity with the conceptual framework Equation 1.2 (on right) for IoT applications and services \n\n1 H\u00f6ller Jan et al., Machine-to-Machine to the Internet of Things, pp. 163-165, Elsevier, 2014 2http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sensorwebdwg. \n\n42 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nNew applications and services are present at the application layer 6. A modification to this is that the application-support layer 5 uses protocols, such as CoAP. (Section 3.1.1). IoT  applications and services commonly use them for network communication. The CoAP protocol at the layer is used for the request/response interactions between the client and server at the network. Similarly, the application-support layer may include processes for data managing, acquiring, organising and analysing which are mostly used by applications and services. \n\nModifications are also at the data-link layer 2 (L2) and physical layer 1 (L1). The new layers are data-adaptation (new L2) and physical cum data-link (new L1). The data- adaptation layer includes a gateway. The gateway enables communication between the devices network and the web. \n\nA physical IoT/M2M device hardware may integrate a wireless transceiver using a communication protocol as well as a data-link protocol for linking the data stacks of L1 and L2. \n\nExample 2.1 explains the IETF six-layer OSI model for Internet of streetlights. \n\nExample 2.1 \n\nProblem What are the architectural layers in a modified OSI model for Internet of smart streetlights application in Example 1.1? \n\nSolution \n\nConsider a model for Internet of streetlights (Figure 1.1). Following are the layers for data interchange in the modified OSI model: \n\n\u25cfL1: It consists of smart sensing and data-link circuits with each streetlight transferring the sensed data to L2. \n\n\u25cfL2: It consists of a group-controller which receives data of each group through Bluetooth or ZigBee, aggregates and compacts the data for communication to the Internet, and controls the group streetlights as per the program commands from a central station. \n\n\u25cfL3: It communicates a network stream on the Internet to the next layer. \n\n\u25cfL4: The transport layer does device identity management, identity registry and data routing to the next layer \n\n\u25cfL5: The application-support layer does data managing, acquiring, organising and analysing, and functionalities of standard protocols such as CoAP, UDP and IP. \n\n\u25cfL6: The application layer enables remote programming and issue of central station directions to switch on-off and commands of services to the controllers along with monitoring each group of streetlights in the whole city. \n\n2.2.2 ITU-T Reference Model \n\nFigure 2.2 shows the ITU-T reference model RM1. It also shows correspondence of the model with the six-layers modified OSI model (Figure 2.1). The figure also shows a comparison with CISCO IoT reference model RM2 (Figure 1.4). RM1 considers four layers which are: \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 43 \n\n\u25cfLowest layer, L1, is the device layer and has device and gateway capabilities. \n\n\u25cfNext layer, L2, has transport and network capabilities. \n\n\u25cfNext layer, L3, is the services and application-support layer. The support layer has two types of capabilities\u2014generic and specific service or application-support capabilities. \n\n\u25cfTop layer, L4, is for applications and services. ITU-T recommends four layers, each with different capabilities. A comparison of ITU-T RM1 with the six-layer OSI model can be made as follows: \n\n\u25cfRM1 device layer capabilities are similar to data-adaptation and physical cum data- link layers. \n\n\u25cfRM1 network layer capabilities are similar to transport and network layers. \n\n\u25cfRM1 upper two layer capabilities are similar to top two layers. A comparison with the CISCO IoT reference model (RM2) can be made as follows: \n\n\u25cfRM1 L4 capabilities are similar to RM2 collaborations and processes, and application top two levels. \n\n\u25cfRM1 L3 capabilities are similar to RM2 three middle-level functions of data abstraction, accumulation, analysis and transformation. \n\n\u25cfRM1 L2 layer capabilities are similar to RM2 functions at connectivity level. \n\n\u25cfRM1 L1 device layer capabilities are similar to RM2 functions at physical devices level. \n\nApplication \n\nNetwork \n\nApplication (Services and Applications) (L4) \n\nServices and Application-Support Layer (Generic and Specific Support Capabilities) (L3) \n\nData Abstraction \n\nApplication \n\nData Accumulation \n\nConnectivity Network Layer (Transport and Network Capabilities) (L2) \n\nDevice Layer (Device and Gateway Capabilities) (L2) Physical cum Data-link Layer \n\nData Adaptation \n\nTransport \n\nApplication Support \n\nPhysical Devices \n\nCollaborations and Processes \n\nData Element Analysis and Transformation \n\nFigure 2.2  ITU-T reference model RM1, its correspondence with six layers of modified OSI and a \n\ncomparison with seven levels suggested in CISCO IoT reference model RM2 \n\n44 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nExample 2.2 explains ITU-T reference model for Internet of RFIDs. \n\nExample 2.2 \n\nProblem What are the architectural layers in ITU-T reference model for Internet of RFIDs application? \n\nSolution \n\nConsider a model for Internet of RFIDs. Following are the capabilities of the layers and data interchange in the ITU-T reference model. Layer 1: Device and gateway capabilities are present in the RFID physical device cum RFID reader which acquires the ID data, and communicates the enriched data according to a wireless protocol to an access point (AP). Layer 2: Transport and network capabilities are present at access network consisting of APs and Internet connectivity to servers. Layer 3: Services and application-support layer capabilities at server are RFID device\u2019s registry, ID management, RFIDs data routing to server or data centre, data analysis for the time-series device presence and device tracked positions. Layer 4: Services and applications of RFIDs are tracking, inventory control of goods and business processes; for example, supply-chain management. \n\n2.2.3 ETSI M2M Domains and High-level Capabilities \n\nA domain specifies the functional areas. High-level architecture means architecture for functional and structural views. Figure 2.3 shows ETSI M2M domains and architecture, and the high-level capabilities of each domain. It also shows that the architecture correspondences with the six-layer modified OSI model as well as the four layers of the ITU-T reference model. The ETSI network domain has six capabilities and functions: \n\n1. M2M applications 2. M2M service capabilities 3. M2M management functions 4. Network management functions 5. CoRE network (for example, 3G and IP networks, network control functions, \n\ninterconnections among networks) 6. Access network (for example, LPWAN (low power wide area network), WLAN \n\n(Wi-Fi) and WiMax networks) The ETSI device and gateway domain has the following functional units: \n\n\u25cfGateway between M2M area network, and CoRE and access network, possessing M2M service capabilities and applications \n\n\u25cfM2M area network (for example, Bluetooth, ZigBee NFC, PAN, LAN) \n\n\u25cfM2M devices Example 2.3 explains M2M ETSI domains and high-level architecture for applications and services ATMs-to-bank servers. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 45 \n\nApplication and Network Domain (Applications, Management, Service Capabilities, and Core and Access Networks) \n\nDevice and Gateway Domain [Gateway (M2M Service Capabilities, Applications), M2M Area Network and M2M Devices] \n\nApplication \n\nApplication Support \n\nTransport \n\nNetwork \n\nData Adaptation \n\nPhysical cum Data-link Layer \n\nApplication (Services and Applications) \n\nServices and Application-Support Layer (Generic and Specific Support Capabilities) \n\nNetwork Layer (Transport and Network capabilities) \n\nDevice Layer (Device and Gateway Capabilities) \n\nFigure 2.3  ETSI M2M domain architecture and its high-level capabilities, and its correspondences with \n\nsix layers of modified OSI and four layers of ITU-T reference model \n\nExample 2.3 \n\nProblem What are domains and their service capabilities in ETSI high-level architecture for applications and services in Internet of ATM machines? \n\nSolution \n\nETSI high-level architecture for applications and services in Internet of ATM machines has two domains: \n\n\u25cfDevice and gateway domain: Device refer to cards and ATMs, while ATM service capabilities and ATM applications are present at the ATM gateway. The gateway has system for acquiring the card as well as banking data. Data interchange between an ATM machine and the bank server takes place through the gateway. The domain has cash dispensing and surveillance systems. All the ATM systems network through an access network. The gateway communicates the data after enriching and transcoding according to the network protocol between an AP and data for the machine. A domain subsystem monitors cash dispensing and other services. \n\n\u25cfApplications and network domain: Application and network domain has two functional units\u2014ATM management functions and network management functions. It has banking applications and service capabilities for the ATMs. It communicates with the bank CoRE network which connects all the access networks of ATM gateways. \n\n46 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfInternational organisations IETF, ITU-T and ETSI have recently taken the initiative and recommendations for layers, capabilities, domains and architecture standardisation for IoT/M2M systems. \n\n\u25cfThree proposed international standards, proposed conceptual frameworks, IoT architectures and reference models of IBM, Oracle and CISCO have similarities. \n\n\u25cfArchitectural layers and domains in IoT/M2M examples\u2014Internet of streetlights, Internet of RFIDs and Internet of ATMs\u2014are shown using modified OSI, ITU-T and ETSI standard specifications. \n\n\u25cfThe IETF six-layer model proposes an application-support layer in place of a session and presentation layers in the OSI model. CoAP is an application-support layer protocol. CoAP transactions use the request/response interactions model. \n\n\u25cfThe IETF six-layer model has a data-adaptation layer in place of a data-link layer. An adaptation layer protocol is 6LoWPAN [IPv6 over low power wireless personal area networks (WPAN)]. The model has a physical cum data-link layer in place of the physical layer in the OSI. \n\n\u25cfThe ITU-T reference model has a layer for applications and services, and three more layers for three other types of capabilities. \n\n\u25cfThe ETSI high-level M2M architecture has two domains. One is a network domain which has six capabilities and functions. The ETSI device and gateway domain has functional units consisting of gateway, CoRE and access network, M2M area network and M2M devices. \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

A local network of IoT or M2M device deploys one of the two types of technologies\u2014 wireless or wired communication technologies.

The connectivity between the devices (left-hand side) is by using RF, Bluetooth Smart Energy, ZigBee IP, ZigBee NAN (neighbourhood area network), NFC or 6LoWPAN or mobile. Tens of bytes communicate at an instance between the device and local devices network. \n\nFollowing subsections describe the technologies and standards recommended for the communication. \n\n2.3.1 Wireless Communication Technology \n\nPhysical cum data-link layer uses wired or wireless communication technologies. Examples of wireless communication technologies are NFC, RFID, ZigBee, \n\nExplain wireless \n\nand wired communication technologies for physical cum data-link \n\nlayer functions \n\nLO 2.2 \n\nWireless and wired \n\ntechnologies for communication of data \n\nfrom and to devices \n\n48 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nBluetooth (BT), RF transceivers and RF modules. Following subsections describe these wireless communication technologies. \n\nNear-Field Communication \n\nNear-Field communication (NFC) is an enhancement of ISO/IEC214443 standard for contact-less proximity-card. \n\nNFC is a short distance (20 cm) wireless communication technology. It enables data exchange between cards in proximity and other devices. Examples of applications of NFC are proximity-card reader/RFID/IoT/M2M/mobile device, mobile payment wallet, electronic keys for car, house, office entry keys and biometric passport readers. \n\nNFC devices transmit and receive data at the same instance and the setup time (time taken to start the communication) is 0.1 s. The device or its reader can generate RF fields for the nearby passive devices such as passive RFID. An NFC device can check RF field and detect collision of transmitted signals. The device can check collision when the received signal bits do not match with the transmitted signal bits. Features of an NFC device are: \n\nRange of functioning is within 10 to 20 cm. The device can also communicate with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices in order to extend the distance from 10 cm to 30 m or higher. The device is able to receive and pass the data to a Bluetooth connection or standardised LAN or Wi-Fi using information handover functions. Device data transfer rates are 106 kbps, 212 kbps, 424 kbps and 848 kbps (bps stands for bit per second, kbps for kilo bit per second). Three modes of communication are: \n\n1. Point-to-point (P2P) mode: Both devices use the active devices in which RF fields \n\nalternately generate when communicating. 2. Card-emulation mode: Communication without interruption for the read and write \n\nas required in a smart card and smart card reader. FeliCa\u2122 and Mifare\u2122 standards are protocols for reading and writing data on the card device and reader, and then the reader can transfer information to Bluetooth or LAN. 3. Reader mode: Using NFC the device reads passive RFID device. The RF field is \n\ngenerated by an active NFC device. This enables the passive device to communicate. \n\nRFID \n\nRadio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an automatic identification method. RFIDs use the Internet. RFID usage is, therefore, in remote storage and retrieval of data is done at the RFID tags. An RFID device functions as a tag or label, which may be placed on an object. The object can then be tracked for the movements. The object may be a parcel, person, bird or an animal. IoT applications of RFID are in business processes, such as parcels tracking and inventory control, sales log-ins and supply-chain management. Section 7.5.1 describes the details of the technology. \n\n2 ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization and IEC stands for International Electrotechnical Commis- sion. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 49 \n\nBluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth Low Energy \n\nBluetooth devices follow IEEE 802.15.1 standard protocol for L1 (physical cum data-link layer). BT devices form a WPAN devices network. Two types of modes for the devices are Bluetooth BR/EDR (Basic Rate 1 Mbps/Enhanced Data Rate 2 Mbps and 3 Mbps) and Bluetooth low energy (BT LE 1Mbps). A latest version is Bluetooth v4.2. BT LE is also called Bluetooth Smart. Bluetooth v4.2 (December 2014) provides the LE data packet length extension, link layer privacy and secure connections, extended scanner and filter link layer policies and IPSP. BT LE range is 150 m at 10 mW power output, data transfer rate is 1 Mbps and setup time is less than 6 s. \n\nBluetooth v5, released in June 2016, has increased the broadcast capacity by 800%, quadrupled the range and doubled the speed. \n\nA device may have provisions for single mode BT LE or dual mode BT BR/EDR (Mbps stands for Million Bits per second). Its features are: \n\n\u25cfAuto-synchronisation between mobile and other devices when both use BT. BT network uses features of self-discovery, self-configuration and self-healing. \n\n\u25cfRadio range depending on class of radio; Class 1 or 2 or radios: 100 m, 10 m or 1 m used in device BT implementation. \n\n\u25cfSupport to NFC pairing for low latency in pairing the BT devices. \n\n\u25cfTwo modes\u2014dual or single mode devices are used for IoT/M2M devices local area network. \n\n\u25cfIPv6 connection option for BT Smart with IPSP (Internet Protocol Support Profile). \n\n\u25cfSmaller packets in LE mode. \n\n\u25cfOperation in secured as well as unsecured modes (devices can opt for both link-level as well as service-level security or just service level or unsecured level). \n\n\u25cfAES-CCM 128 authenticated encryption algorithm for confidentiality and authentication (Refer Example 2.4). \n\n\u25cfConnection of IoT/M2M/mobile devices using BT EDR device to the Internet with 24 Mbps Wi-Fi 802.11 adaptation layer (AMP: Alternative MAC/PHY layer) or BT-enabled wire-bound connection ports or device. MAC stands for media access control sublayer at a data-link layer/sublayer. \n\nExample 2.4 \n\nProblem How does the Bluetooth layer provide confidentiality and authorisation? \n\nSolution \n\nA standard algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Algorithm) based on symmetric 128-bit block data encryption and CCM mode\u00a0 (Counter with\u00a0 CBC-MAC) provides the confidentiality and authorisation. CBC stands for cryptographic block cipher with a block length of 128 bits. CCM is a method which provisions for the authenticated encryption algorithm for confidentiality and authentication. \n\n50 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nZigBee IP/ZigBee SE 2.0 \n\nZigBee devices follow the IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol L1 (physical cum data-link layer). ZigBee devices form a WPAN devices network. \n\nZigBee end-point devices form a WPAN of embedded sensors, actuators, appliances, controllers or medical data systems which connect to the Internet for IoT applications, services and business processes. \n\nZigBee Neighbourhood Area Network (NAN) is a version for a smart grid. ZigBee smart energy version 2.0 has energy management and energy efficiency capabilities using an IP network. The features of ZigBee IP are: \n\n\u25cfL1 layer PDU = 127 B \n\n\u25cfUsed for low-power, short-range WPAN \n\n\u25cfThe device can function in six modes\u2014end point, ZigBee-ZigBee devices router, ZigBee network coordinator, ZigBee-IP coordinator, ZigBee-IP router and IP host. \n\n\u25cfZigBee IP enhancement provisions the IPv6 connectivity. A ZigBee IP device is a Reduced Function Device (RFD). RFD means one that functions for the \u2018sleepy\u2019/ battery-operated device. Sleepy means one that wakes up infrequently, sends data and then goes back to sleep. ZigBee IP supports IPv6 network with 6LoWPAN header compression, connection for Internet communication and control of low power devices, TCP/UDP transport layer and TLSv1.2 public key (RSA and ECC) and PSK cipher suite for end-to-end security protocol, end-to-end means application layer to physical layer. \n\n\u25cfThe ZigBee router uses reactive and proactive protocols for routing mode, which enable applications in big-scale automation and remote controls. \n\n\u25cfA self-configuring and self-healing dynamic pairing mesh network, supports both multicast and unicast options. \n\n\u25cfMulticast forwarding to support multicast Domain Name System (mDNS) based service discovery (SD) \n\n\u25cfSupport to development of discovery mechanism with full application confirmation \n\n\u25cfSupport to pairing of coordinator with end-point devices and routers in star topology \n\n\u25cfProvides bigger network using multiple star topology and inter-PAN communications \n\n\u25cfSupport to sensor nodes and sensor (or appliances) network integration, sensor and appliances devices configured as router or end-devices \n\n\u25cfLow latency (< 10 ms) link layer connection \n\n\u25cfRange is 10\u2013200 m, data transfer rate is 250 kbps, low power operation \n\n\u25cfISM band frequencies direct sequence spread spectrum 16-channel radio, and provide link level security using AES-CCM-128 (Example 2.4) \n\n\u25cfIncludes RFD in ZigBee SE 2.0 ZigBee NAN is for devices which are used for smart-metering, distribution automation devices and smart grid communication profile. NAN enables a utility\u2019s last-mile at HAN (Home Area Network), outdoor access network that connects smart meters to WAN (wide- area network) gateways. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 51 \n\nFigure 2.5 shows ZigBee End Point, Coordinator, Router, ZigBee IP Router modes forming star, mesh and IP networks of ZigBee sensors, end devices and ZigBee router device which interconnect to Internet IPv4, IPv6 and to cellular networks. \n\nFigure 2.5 shows: \n\n\u25cfThree end devices, two routers, one sensor node connected to coordinator ZigBee devices forming a star network. \n\n\u25cfOne end device, two routers and one coordinator forming a mesh network. \n\n\u25cfMesh network router connects to an AP/gateway, which in turn connects to a cellular network. \n\n\u25cfCoordinator of mesh network connects to ZigBee IP border router, which enables local ZigBee networks\u2019 connectivity to the Internet. \n\nCellular Network \n\nEnd Device 4 Router \n\nRouter Mesh Network Coordinator \n\nAccess \n\nPoint/ Gateway 1000s of Bytes IPv4 Network \n\nApplication \n\nWeb Objects \n\nSSL/TLS \n\nTCP UDP ICMP \n\nApplication \n\nSSL/TLS ND/ RPL \n\nUDP ICMP TCP \n\nIPv6 \n\nIPv6 Network 100s/1000s of Bytes \n\n6LowPAN \n\nZigBee \n\nIP Border Router Router Coordinator \n\nEnd Device 2 Sensor Node 1 End Device 1 \n\n127 Bytes \n\nIEEE 802.15.4 Devices \n\nEnd Device 3 \n\nStar Network \n\nPhysical/Data-link Layer Data-Adaptation Layer \n\nFigure 2.5  ZigBee end point, coordinator, router, ZigBee IP router nodes forming the star, mesh and IP \n\nnetworks of ZigBee sensors, end devices, and ZigBee router devices which interconnect to Internet IPv4, IPv6 and cellular networks Features of a ZigBee network are: \n\n\u25cfA router in star network connects to 6LoWPAN, which connects an IEEE 802.15.4 devices network to IPv6 network. \n\n\u25cf1000s of byte communicate between the network layer and IoT web objects. \n\n\u25cf127 B communication between the adaptation layer IEEE 802.15.4 devices at single data transfer. \n\n\u25cfIETF ND (Neighbour Discovery), ROLL (Routing Over Low power Loss Network), RPL routing, IPv6/IPv4 network, TCP/UDP/ICMP transport, SSL/TLS security layer protocols for the communication between web object/application and ZigBee devices. \n\n52 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nWi-Fi \n\nWi-Fi is an interface technology that uses IEEE 802.11 protocol and enables the Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). Wi-Fi devices connect enterprises, universities and offices through home AP/public hotspots. Wi-Fi connects distributed WLAN networks using the Internet. \n\nAutomobiles, instruments, home networking, sensors, actuators, industrial device nodes, computers, tablets, mobiles, printers and many devices have Wi-Fi interface. They network using a Wi-Fi network. \n\nWi-Fi is very popular. The issues of Wi-Fi interfaces, APs and routers are higher power consumption, interference and performance degradation. \n\nWi-Fi interfaces connect within themselves or to an AP or wireless router using Wi-Fi PCMCIA or PCI card or built-in circuit cards and through the following: \n\n\u25cfBase station (BS) or AP \n\n\u25cfA WLAN transceiver or BS can connect one or many wireless devices simultaneously to the Internet. \n\n\u25cfPeer-to-peer nodes without access point: Client devices within Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) network can communicate directly with each other. It enables fast and easy setting of an 802.11 network. \n\n\u25cfPeer to multipoint nodes with Basic Service Sets (BSSs) using one in-between AP point or distributed BSSs connect through multiple APs. \n\n\u25cfConnectivity range of each BSS depends on the range of wireless bridges and antennae used and environmental conditions. \n\n\u25cfEach BSS is a Service Set Identifier (SSID). Figure 2.6 shows three WLAN networks (BSSs) for sensor device nodes, mobiles, tablets, laptops, computers and Internet connectivity of WLAN networks with the IP4 networks (here dashed lines represent wireless connectivity and solid lines represent wired connectivity). Figure 2.6 shows the following: \n\n\u25cfSensor nodes connected to BT with Wi-Fi adaptation, 802.11 interfaces in a WLAN network 1 (WLAN1). \n\n\u25cfTablets, Wi-Fi, computers also connect in WLAN 1 though an AP. \n\n\u25cfAP1 connects to a broadband router 1 and to the IP4 network 2. \n\n\u25cfWLAN1 and WLAN2 function as BSS. \n\n\u25cfWLAN 2 also consists of AP2, Wi-Fi router and other Wi-Fi enabled interfaces. \n\n\u25cfWi-Fi router connects to multiple Wi-Fi nodes as well as to a broadband router 2. \n\n\u25cfBroadband routers 1 and 2 connect using wires, to IP4 networks and web objects for IoT apps, services and processes. The Wi-Fi interfaces, access points, routers features are as follows: \n\n\u25cfGenerally used are the 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.11b adapters or 5 GHz (802.11a or 802.11g) or 802.11n or other 802.11 series protocols. \n\n\u25cfInterfaces use 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz antenna \n\n\u25cfOffers mobility and roaming \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 53 \n\nRoaming between networks 1 and 2 \n\nWeb Objects \n\nTCP UDP ICMP \n\nSSL/TLS \n\nApplication \n\nIPv4  Network \n\nWi-Fi Access \n\nPoint \n\nWLAN Network 2 \n\nWLAN   Network 1 \n\nMobile \n\nSensor Node \n\nSensor Node \n\nSensor Node \n\nSensor Node \n\nPhysical/Data-link Layer \n\nWLAN Network 3 \n\nIPv4  Network \n\nIPv4  Network \n\nPCMCIA Wi-Fi Card \n\nWi-Fi Wireless \n\nRouter \n\nMobile or Tablet with \n\n802.11 Interface \n\nWi-Fi Access \n\nPoint/ Gateway \n\nComputer with PCI Wi-Fi card \n\nMobile Wi-Fi \n\nInterface \n\nLaptop PCMCIA Wi-Fi Card \n\nComputer with PCI Wi-Fi card Laptop PCMCIA \n\nWi-Fi Card Mobile Wi-Fi \n\nBluetooth with 802.11 \n\nAMP \n\nBroadband \n\nRouter \n\nFigure 2.6  Three WLAN networks for sensor device nodes, mobiles, tablets, laptops, computers and \n\nInternet connectivity of WLAN networks with the IP4 networks (Dashed lines show wireless connectivity and solid lines show wired connectivity) \n\n\u25cfHave easy installation simplicity and flexibility \n\n\u25cfCoverage range is 30 m to 125 m \n\n\u25cfUsed in a room having the limited-coverage 802.11a which coexists with b, coexists with b and g \n\n\u25cfUses the 802.11b in wider coverage range because that is unaffected by walls and is meant for hotspots for public usage having range data rate 11 Mbps (802.11b) within 30 m \n\n\u25cfUses 802.11g for high data rates up to 54 Mbps, and 802.11n for very high 600 Mbps, using multiple antennas to increase data rates \n\n\u25cfInteroperable with wireless as well as wired infrastructure which ensures compatibility and enables easier access and hides complexity when enabling the wireless access to data, media and streams, and applications and services. \n\n\u25cfProvides a dynamic environment of network expendability and scalability. Scalability means a system can have a large number of smaller interfaces, routers and APs \n\n\u25cfProvides security, integrity and reliability \n\n\u25cfUses Wireless Protected Access (WPA) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security sublayers \n\nRF Transceivers and RF Modules RF transmitters, receivers, and transceivers are the simplest RF circuits. A transceiver transmits the RF from one end and receives the RF from the other end, but internally has \n\n54 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nan additional circuit, which separates the signals from both ends. An oscillator generates RF pulses of required active duty cycle and connects to a transmitter. BT, ZigBee, and Wi- Fi radios deploy ISM band transceivers, which have comparatively complex circuits. \n\nIoT/M2M applications deploy ISM band RF modules with transceivers or just transmitter or receiver. A number of systems use RF modules for applications needing wireless connectivity; for example, security, telemetry, telematics, fleet management, home automation, healthcare, automobiles wireless tire pressure monitors, back-up cameras and GPS navigation service, payment wallet, RFID and maintenance. RF technology consists of the following elements: \n\n\u25cfRF interface/physical layer, RF signals transmit between the nodes or endpoints, i.e. the sensors, actuators, controllers and a gateway where signals are received. Physical layer specifications consist of signal aspects and characteristics, including the frequencies, modulation format, power levels, the transmitting and receiving mode and signalling between end-point elements. \n\n\u25cfRF network architecture includes the overall system architecture, backhaul, server and bidirectional end-devices with radio duty cycling in the applications. Radio duty cycling means managing the active intervals, transmission and receiving schedule, and time-intervals actions on an event during the active intervals and actions during the inactive (sleep) intervals using the RF Integrated Circuits (RFICs). \n\nGPRS/GSM Cellular Networks-Mobile Internet \n\nAn IoT/M2M communication gateway can access a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN). The network access may use a GPRS cellular network or new generation cellular network for Internet access. \n\nA mobile phone provisions for a USB wired port, BT and Wi-Fi connectivity. Wireless connectivity for Internet uses data connectivity using GSM, GPRS, UMTS/LTE and WiMax services of a mobile service provider or Wi-Fi using a modem. A phone, generally, provisions for number of sensors also; for example, acceleration, GPS and proximity. \n\nWireless USB \n\nWireless USB is a wireless extension of USB 2.0 and it operates at ultra-wide band (UWB) 5.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz frequencies. It is for short-range personal area network (high speed 480 Mbps 3 m or 110 Mbps 10 m channel). FCC recommends a host wire adapter (HWA) and a device wire adapter (DWA), which provides wireless USB solution. Wireless USB also supports dual-role devices (DRDs). A device can be a USB device as well as limited capability host. \n\n2.3.2 Wired Communication Technology \n\nWired communication can be serial asynchronous communication (for example, UART interface) or synchronous serial communication (for example, SPI interface or parallel \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 55 \n\ninput, output and input-output ports at the devices). Communication can be over a bus when a number of systems (chips, units, integrated circuits or ports or interfacing circuits) connect through a common set of interconnections. \n\nBus refers to a number of systems connected through a common set of control, address and data signals such that the data signals are accepted by the device at destination address only from a source at an instance. Bus signals may be sent in a serial or parallel manner. Communication is between a master at a given instance (sender) and the destined address computer (listener) at an instance. \n\nWired communication can be done using Ethernet IEEE 802.2 bus specifications. A MAC sublayer data frame may be according to Ethernet Protocol. Wired communication can also use a USB port, a microUSB or a USB 3.0 adapter. \n\nUART/USART Serial Communication \n\nA Universal Asynchronous Transmitter (UART) enables serial communication (transmission) of 8 bits serially with a start bit at the start of transmission of a byte on serial Transmitter Data (TxD) output line. Serial means present one after another at successive time intervals. \n\nAsynchronous refers to all bytes in a frame transmit, which can result in variation in time interval spacing or phase differences between successive bytes and in-between wait interval. This is because clock information of transmitter does not transmit along with the data. The receiver clock also does not synchronise with the data. Further, successive set of bytes may wait after transmission till an acknowledgement is received from the receiving end. \n\nThe intervals of each transmit bit are controlled by a clock. When the clock period is T = 0.01 ms, then period for transmission of a byte on TxD = 10 T = 0.1 ms. A byte\u2019s transfer rate is 1 MBps. Reciprocal of T in UART is called Baud rate. When an additional bit appends between stop bit and last bit of the byte, then T = 0.11 ms. An additional bit can be used to identify the received byte on the serial line as the address or data. It can be used for error detection. UART receives the byte at RxD (transmitter data) input line. \n\nAn Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Transmitter (USART) enables serial communication (transmission) in synchronous as well as asynchronous modes. \n\nSynchronous means all bytes in a frame transmit with equal time spacing or equal phase differences. \n\nSerial Peripheral Interface \n\nSerial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is one of the widely used serial synchronous communication methods. Source of serial synchronous output or input is called master when it also controls the synchronising clock information to the receiver. A receiver of serial synchronous input or output is called a slave, when along with the serial data it also receives the synchronising clock information from the master. Four sets of signals, viz., SCLK, MISO, MOSI, and SS (slave select)  are used on four wires. When SS is active, then the device functions as a slave. \n\n56 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nMaster Input Slave Output (MISO) and Master Output Slave Input (MOSI) are synchronous serial bits I/Os at the master and slave and IOs are as per synchronising clock of the master SCLK. \n\nMOSI is output from master and input at slave and SCLK (clock information or signal) is from the master to slave. Slave synchronises and receives the input bits at MOSI from the master as per the SCLK input at slave. \n\nMISO is synchronous serial input at the master for the serial output from slave. Slave synchronises output as per SCLK of the master. Master synchronises the input as per SCLK of the master. \n\nI2C Bus \n\nA number of device integrated circuits for sensors, actuators, flash memory and touchscreens need data exchanges in a number of processes. ICs mutually network through a common synchronous serial bus, called inter-integrated circuit (I2C). Four potential modes of operation (viz. master transmit, master receive, slave transmit and slave receive) for I2C bus device and generally most devices have a single role and use two modes only. \n\nThe I2C was originally developed at Philips Semiconductors. There are three I2C bus standards: Industrial 100 kbps I2C, 100 kbps SM I2C and 400 kbps I2C. \n\nI2C bus has two lines that carry the signals\u2014one line is for the clock and one is for bidirectional data. I2C bus protocol has specific fields. Each field has a specific number of bits, sequences and time intervals between them. \n\nWired USB \n\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is for fast serial transmission and reception between the hosts, the embedded system and distributed serial devices; for example, like connecting a keyboard, printer or scanner. USB is a bus between the host system and a number of interconnected peripheral devices. Maximum 127 devices can connect with a host. USB standard provides a fast (up to 12 Mbps) as well as a low-speed (up to 1.5 Mbps) serial transmission and reception between the host and serial devices. Both the host and device can function in a system. \n\nUSB three standards are USB 1.1 (1.5 and 12 Mbps), 2.0 (mini size connector) 480 Mbps, 3.0 (micro size connector) 5 Gbps and 3.1 (super speed 10 Gbps). \n\nFeatures of a USB are: USB data format and transfer serial signals are Non Return to Zero (NRZI) and the clock is encoded by inserting synchronous code (SYNC) field before each packet. The receiver synchronises bit recovery clock continuously. The data transfer is of four types\u2014controlled data transfer, bulk data transfer, interrupt driven data transfer and isosynchronous transfer. \n\nUSB is a polled bus. Polling mode functions as: A host controller regularly polls the presence of a device as scheduled by the software. It sends a token packet. The token consists of fields for type, direction, USB device address and device end-point number. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 57 \n\nThe device does handshaking through a handshake packet, indicating successful or unsuccessful transmission. A CRC field in a data packet permits error detection. \n\nA USB supports three types of pipes\u2014Stream with no USB-defined protocol is used when the connection is already established and the data flow starts. Default control is for providing access. Message is for control functions of the device. The host configures each pipe with the data bandwidth to be used, transfer service type and buffer sizes. \n\nEthernet \n\nEthernet standard is IEEE 802.2 (ISO 8802.2) protocol for local area network of computers, workstations and device LANs. Each frame at a LAN consists of header. Ethernet enables the services of local device nodes, computers, systems and local resources, such as printers, hard disk space, software and data. \n\nFeatures of Ethernet network are: \n\n\u25cfUses passive broadcast medium and is wired connections based \n\n\u25cfFormatting of frame (serially sent bits as PDU of MAC layer) is according to IEEE 802.2 standard \n\n\u25cfUses a 48-bit MAC address assigned distinctly to each computer on the LAN \n\n\u25cfAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) resolves a 32 bit IP address at Internet device LANs. Each frame at a LAN destination host media address. Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) resolves 48 bit destination host media address into 32 bit IP addresses for Internet communication. \n\n\u25cfUses wired bus topology, and transmission speeds are 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps (unshielded and shielded wires), 1 Gbps (high-quality coaxial cable), 4 Gbps (in twisted pair wiring mode) and 10 Gbps (fiber-optic cables). \n\n\u25cfUses MAC-based on CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection). The CSMA/CD mode is half-duplex (wired mode) which means transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) signals can be sent on the same wire or data path. Each one connected to a common communication channel in the network listens and if the channel is idle then transmits. If not idle, it waits and tries again. A mode is full-duplex in case of optical-fibre-based Ethernet that transmits and receives signals separated on dedicated, one-way channels. \n\n\u25cfUses transmission data stack into frames at MAC layer, and each frame includes a header. The header\u2019s first eight bytes specify a preamble. The preamble is for indicating start of a frame and is used for synchronisation. Then the header has next six bytes\u2019 destination address and then six bytes of the source address. Then next six bytes are for the type field. These are meaningful only for the higher network layers and define the length of the data stack to the next layer. Next, minimum 72 bytes and maximum 1500 bytes of data follow the length definition. The last 4 bytes are for CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for the frame sequence check. \n\n2.3.3 Communication Technologies\u2014A Comparison \n\nTable 2.1 shows a comparison of communication technologies. \n\n58 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nTable 2.1 Differences between NFC, BT LE, ZigBee and WLAN protocols \n\nProperty NFC BT LE ZigBee IP WLAN 802.11 \n\nIEEE Protocol 802.15.1 802.15.4 802.11z \n\nPhysical Layer 848, 424, 212, 106 kbps \n\n2.4 GHz (LE-DSSS) 2.4 GHz or 915 MHz, 868 MHz and 433 MHz DSSS MAC layer CSMA/ CA \n\n2.4 GHz Two PHY layers MAC layer CSMA/CD \n\nData Transfer Rate \n\n106 kbps 1 Mbps 250 kbps (2.4 GHz, 40 kbps 915 MHz, 20 kbps 868.3 MHz \n\n11 Mbps/54 Mbps \n\nForm Factor and Range \n\n10\u201320 cm Small Small 10 m to 200 m \n\nBigger \n\nProtocol Stack Small in LE 127 B Bigger than WPAN devices \n\nPower Dissipation Very low Lower than ZigBee, much lower than WLAN 802.11 \n\n2 mW Router and 0.1 mW for end- device Much lower than WLAN 802.11 \n\nMuch Higher than ZigBee \n\nSet up/ Connection/ Disconnection Intervals \n\n0.1 s 3s Connection time < 3 ms \n\n20 ms Connection time < 10 ms \n\nSecurity \u2014 AES-CCM-128 AES-CCM-128 WEP \n\nApplications Payment wallet, short distance communi- cation \n\nWPAN, IoT/M2M devices, widely present in mobiles and tablets and, need addition circuit in sensors, actuators, controllers  and IoT devices \n\nWPAN, wider presence in sensors, actuators, controllers, automobile and medical electronic and IoT devices connectivity using IPv6, 6loWPAN, ROLL, RPL and TLSv1.2 \n\nWLAN and WWAN network tablet, desktops, mobiles, devices with PCMCIA interface, home networking, Easy IPv4 connectivity \n\nNetwork Point to point between active and passive devices \n\nStar topology, peer- to-peer piconet expended by inter- piconets data transactions and synchronisation \n\nLow power, mesh or peer-to peer star networks using end devices, coordinator, router, ZigBee IP border router \n\nLAN topology IBSS, BSS and distributed BSSs for WWLAN widely used for Internet connectivity of mobiles, tablets, desktops \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 59 \n\nNetwork Characteristics \n\nP2P mode, card emulation mode and reader mode Passive neighbour activation \n\nSelf-configuring, self- healing, self-discovery \n\nSelf-configuring, self-healing, self- discovery \n\nScalable, interoperability, security, integrity and reliability \n\nBroadcast/ Multicast/Unicast \n\nUnicast Unicast Unicast/ multicast \n\nUnicast \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfIoT/M2M devices, RFIDs, sensors, actuators and controllers send mostly 10s of bytes of data. \n\n\u25cfNFC, BT low energy, ZigBee IP, ZigBee NAN, RF transceivers and modules and mobile GPRS/GSM are protocols which can be used for physical transmission of bits from the devices (sensors/actuators/RF devices/IEEE 802.15.4 devices/controllers/nodes) or reception at them.

These are data privacy, data security, data enrichment, data consolidation, transformation and device management. Figure 2.7 shows IoT or M2M gateway consisting of data enrichment, consolidation and device management, and communication frameworks (Figure 1.3). \n\nRecall ITU-T reference model (Figure 2.2). The model\u2019s lowest layer is the device layer. This layer has device and gateway capabilities. Also, recall device and gateway domain (Figure 2.3) in ETSI IoT architecture. The domain consists of a gateway between M2M area network and CoRE and access network. A gateway consists of the data enrichment, consolidation and IoT communication frameworks. The communication gateway enables the devices to communicate and network with the web. The communication gateway (Section 3.3.1) uses message transport protocols and web communication protocols for the Internet. Chapter 3 describes these protocols. \n\nThe gateway includes two functions viz. data management and consolidation, and connected device management. \n\nThe following subsections describe the framework for data enrichment and consolidation. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 61 \n\n2.4.1 Data Management and Consolidation Gateway \n\nGateway includes the provisions for one or more of the following functions: transcoding and data management. Following are data management and consolidation functions: \n\n\u25cfTranscoding \n\n\u25cfPrivacy, security \n\n\u25cfIntegration \n\n\u25cfCompaction and fusion \n\nTranscoding \n\nTranscoding means data adaptation, conversion and change of protocol, format or code using software. The gateway renders the web response and messages in formats and representations required and acceptable at an IoT device. Similarly, the IoT device requests are adapted, converted and changed into required formats acceptable at the server by the transcoding software. \n\nFor example, use of transcoding enables the message request characters to be in ASCII format at the device and in Unicode at the server. It also enables the use of XML format database at the device, while the server has a DB2, Oracle or any other database. \n\nTranscoding involves formats, data and code conversion from one end to another when the multimedia data is transferred from a server to the mobile TV, Internet TV, VoIP \n\nTranscoding does the data adaptation, conversion, and change \n\nof protocol, format or \n\ncode \n\nDevice 1 \n\nDevice 2 \n\nDevice \n\n( i \u2013 1) \n\nDevice i \n\n10s of Bytes \n\n10s of Bytes \n\n10s of Bytes \n\n10s of Bytes \n\nPhysical/Data-link Layer Data Adaptation Layer \n\nIP 10s of Bytes \n\nManage Connections \n\nand Subscriptions \n\nDevice Register \n\nand Connect \n\nIoT Communication \n\nFramework \n\n[1000s of Bytes] \n\nCoAP \n\n[Each data transfers 100s of bytes to network and transport layers] \n\n1.

Transcoding applications also involve filtering, compression or decompression. \n\nA transcoding proxy can execute itself on the client system or the application server. A transcoding proxy has conversion, computational and analysing capabilities, while a gateway has conversion and computational capabilities only. \n\nPrivacy \n\nData such as patient medical data, data for supplying goods in a company from and to different locations, and changes in inventories, may need privacy and protection from conscious or unconscious transfer to untrustworthy destinations using the Internet. \n\nPrivacy is an aspect of data management and must be remembered while designing an application. The design should ensure privacy by ensuring that the data at the receiving end is considered anonymous from an individual or company. \n\nFollowing are the components of the privacy model: \n\n\u25cfDevices and applications identity-management \n\n\u25cfAuthentication \n\n\u25cfAuthorisation \n\n\u25cfTrust \n\n\u25cfReputation A suitable encryption of identification of data source enforces privacy. Device ID management provides for privacy. The analysed decrypted data is an input to application, service or process. IoT or M2M data have to be for the beneficiary individual person or company only. \n\nWhen data is transfered from one point to another, it should be ensured that the stakeholder in future may not misuse the device end data or the application data. These static and dynamic relationships are components which depend on trust and reputation. \n\nSecure Data Access \n\nAccess to data needs to be secure. The design ensures the authentication of a request for data and authorisation for accessing a response or service. It may also include auditing of requests and accesses of the responses for accountability in future. Example 2.4 described how a layer provides the confidentiality and authorisation using AES-128 and CCM. \n\nEnd-to-end security is another aspect while implies using a security protocol at each layer, physical, logical link and transport layers during communication at both ends in a network. \n\nData Gathering and Enrichment \n\nIoT/M2M applications involve actions such as data-gathering (acquisition), validation, storage, processing, reminiscence (retention) and analysis. \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 63 \n\nData gathering refers to data acquisition from the devices/devices network. Four modes of gathering data are: \n\n1. Polling refers to the data sought from a device by addressing the device; for example, \n\nwaste container filling information in a waste management system 2. Event-based gathering refers to the data sought from the device on an event; for \n\nexample, when the device reaches near an access point or a card reaches near the card reader or an initial data exchange for the setup of peer-to-peer or master-slave connection of BT device using NFC 3. Scheduled interval refers to the data sought from a device at select intervals; for \n\nexample, data for ambient light condition in Internet of streetlights 4. Continuous monitoring refers to the data sought from a device continuously; for \n\nexample, data for traffic presence in a particular street ambient light condition in Internet of streetlights \n\nData enrichment refers to adding value, security and usability of the data. \n\nData Dissemination \n\nConsider the following three steps for data enrichment before the data disseminates to the network as aggregation, compaction and fusion. \n\nAggregation refers to the process of joining together present and previously received data frames after removing redundant or duplicate data. \n\nCompaction means making information short without changing the meaning or context; for example, transmitting only the incremental data so that the information sent is short. \n\nFusion means formatting the information received in parts through various data frames and several types of data (or data from several sources), removing redundancy in the received data and presenting the formatted information created from the information parts. Data fusion is used in cases when the individual records are not required and/or are not retrievable later. \n\nEnergy Dissipation in Data Dissemination \n\nEnergy consumption for data dissemination is an important consideration in many devices in WPANs and in wireless sensor nodes (WSNs). This is due to limited battery life. Energy is consumed when performing computations and transmissions. Higher the data rate, the greater will be the energy consumed. Higher is RF used, the greater will be the energy consumed. Higher the gathering interval, the lower will be the energy consumed. \n\nEnergy efficient computations can be done by using concepts of data aggregation, compaction and fusion. Lesser the data bytes communication, greater the acquisition intervals, and lower the data rate for data transfer, lesser the energy dissipation. \n\n64 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nData Source and Data Destination \n\nID: Each device and each device resource is assigned an ID for specifying the data of source and a separate ID for data destination. Address: Header fields add the destination address (for example, 48-bit MAC address at Link layer, 32-bit IPv4 address at IP network and 128-bit IPv6 address at IPv6 network) and may also add the port (for example, port 80 for HTTP application). \n\nData Characteristics, Formats and Structures \n\nData characteristics can be in terms of temporal data (dependent on the time), spatial data (dependent on location), real-time data (generated continuously and acquired continuously at the same pace), real-world data (from physical world for example, traffic or streetlight, ambient condition), proprietary data (copy right data reserved for distribution to authorised enterprises) and big data (unstructured voluminous data). \n\nData received from the devices, formats before transmission onto Internet. The  format can be in XML, JSON and TLV (Section 3.1.3). A file can be MIME type for Internet (Section 3.1.5). \n\nStructure implies the ways for arranging the data bytes in sequences with size limit = PDU for a layer. \n\n2.4.2 Device-management Gateway \n\nDevice Management (DM) means provisioning for the device ID or address which is distinct from other resources, device activating, configuring (managing device parameters and settings), registering, deregistering, attaching and  detaching. \n\nDevice management also means accepting subscription for its resources. Device fault management means course of actions and guidelines to be followed in case if a fault develops in the device. \n\nOpen Mobile Alliance (OMA)-DM and several standards are used for device management. OMA-DM model suggests the use of a DM server which interacts with devices through a gateway in case of IoT/M2M applications. A DM server is a server for assigning the device ID or address, activating, configuring (managing device parameters and settings), subscribing to device services or opting out of device services and configuring device modes. A device instead of a DM server, communicates to a gateway in case of low-power loss environment. \n\nGateway functions for device management are: \n\n\u25cfDoes forwarding function when the DM server and device can interact without reformatting or structuring \n\n\u25cfDoes protocol conversion when the device and DM server use distinct protocols \n\n\u25cfDoes proxy function in case an intermediate pre-fetch is required in a lossy environment or network environment needs. \n\nOMA DM model for \n\nusing a DM server \n\nDesign Principles for Connected Devices 65 \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfData communication between personal/local area network of devices and a gateway for communicating via Internet. \n\n\u25cfGateway enables data enrichment and consolidation and device management. \n\n\u25cfData management functions at the gateway are transcoding, data privacy, data security, data enrichment, data consolidation, transformation and device management. \n\n\u25cfTranscoding means adaptations, conversions, changes of protocol or format using software which renders the web response/messages in formats/representations as required and acceptable at the IoT device and rendering requests for messages in formats/representations as required and acceptable at the server. \n\n\u25cfData acquires and transfers to other end at scheduled intervals, on an event, or on polling. \n\n\u25cfData aggregation, compaction and fusion save energy during data dissemination. \n\n\u25cfData destinations may use the 48-bit MAC address, 32-bit IPv4 address, 48-bit IPv6 address or port number during communication at the data-link or network layers. \n\n\u25cfEach device and application has an ID or address of communication source and each destination has an ID or address. Communication between the end points and between the layers is secure when using the authentication and authorisation processes. \n\n\u25cfDevice management functions are the device ID or address, activation, configuring (managing device parameters and settings), registering, deregistering, attaching, detaching and fault management. \n\n\u25cfGateway functions for device management are\u2014forwarding function between DM server and device; protocol conversion when device and DM server use distinct protocols and proxy function. \n\n\u25cfCommunication gateway enables protocol conversion between two ends. \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

Hardware which includes the device should embed minimum number of components and use ready solutions for ease in designing local devices personal area network and secure connectivity with the Internet. \n\nDesigning also considers ease as well as affordances for example, RFID or card. The card has an embedded microcontroller, memory, OS, NFC peripheral interfaces, access point-based device activation, RF module and transceiver at low cost. \n\nA wireless sensor uses, for example, a mobile terminal (Mote) which is a low cost device with an open-source OS (tiny OS) and software components. Usages of Motes provide ease and affordance in a WSN network. \n\nDevices of smart homes and cities use ZigBee IP or BT LE 4.2 (dual mode or single mode) due to their affordability, ease of designing, usage and low cost. \n\nA design may add to the complexity. For example, consider the umbrella in Example 1.1. How will the umbrella be programmed to schedule the SMSes for a user? The need to use an instruction manual adds to the complexity of designing Internet of umbrellas. \n\nConnected devices may add complexity in the form ensuring data transfer to trusted destinations using encryption tools. \n\nDiscuss ease of \n\ndesigning and affordability of IoT \n\ndevices \n\nLO 2.4 \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfEase of designing and affordability are important considerations for devices and applications, services and processes for IoTs. \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.
