The figure shows (i) Devices or sensor \nnetworks data collection at the device web server, (ii) Local files, (iii) Dedicated data store \nat coordinating node, (iii) Local node in a distributed DBMS, (iv) Internet-connected data \ncentre, (v) Internet-connected server, (vi) Internet-connected distributed DBMS nodes, \nand (vii) Cloud infrastructure and services. \n\nCloud computing paradigm is a great evolution in Information and Communications \nTechnology (ICT). The new paradigm uses XAAS at the Internet connected clouds for \ncollection, storage and computing. \n\nFollowing are the key terms and their meanings, which need to be understood before \nlearning about the cloud computing platform. \n\nResource refers to one that can be read (used), written (created of changed) or executed \n(processed). A path specification is also a resource. The resource is atomic (not-further \ndivisible) information, which is usable during computations. A resource may have \nmultiple instances or just a single instance. The data point, pointer, data, object, data store \nor method can also be a resource. \n\nIoT data collection and \n\nstorage methods \n\nOutline Cloud \ncomputing paradigm \n\nfor data collection, \nstorage and computing \n\nservices \n\nLO 6.1 \n\n204 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nDatabase Firewall \n\nCollect + Storage (for the \nApplications, Services, Enterprise \nBusiness Processes and \nBusiness Intelligence) \n\nData \nCentre \n\nServer \n\nIoT/M2M \n\n. \n. \n.. \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork \n\nLocal \n\nFiles \n\nCloud Infrastructure \n\nand Services \n\nCollect \n\nInternet Firewall \n\nCollect \n\nCollect \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork \n\nCollect \n\nCollect \n\nCollect \n\nfrom \nthings \nLocal \nServer \nDedicated \nData Store/ \nCoordinating \n\nNode \n\nDistributed \n\nDatabase \n\nNode \n\nDistributed \n\nDatabase \n\nNodes \n\nIoT/M2M Local device network \ndata collection and storage \n\nFigure 6.1 Devices or sensors network data collection at a device local-server, local files, dedicated data \n\nstore, at a coordinating node, a local node of a distributed DBMS, Internet-connected server \nof data centre, server or distributed database nodes or a cloud infrastructure \n\nSystem resource refers to an operating system (OS), memory, network, server, software or \napplication. \n\nEnvironment refers to an environment for programming, program execution or both. For \nexample, cloud9 online provides an open programming environment for BeagleBone \nboard for the development of IoT devices; Windows environment for programming and \nexecution of applications; Google App Engine environment for creation and execution of \nweb applications in Python or Java. \n\nPlatform denotes the basic hardware, operating system and network, and is used for \nsoftware applications or services over which programs can be run or developed. 1 \n\n1 Based on definition at https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3411/platform \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n205 \n\nA platform may provide a browser and APIs which can be used as a base on which other \napplications can be run or developed. \n\nEdge computing is a type of computing that pushes the frontier of computing applications, \ndata and services away from centralised nodes to IoT data generating nodes, that means \nat logical extremes of the network. 2 IoT device nodes are pushed by events, triggers, alerts, \nmessages and data is collected for enrichment, storage and computations from the remote \ncentralised database nodes. Pushing the computations from centralised nodes enables the \nusage of resources at device nodes, which could be a requirement in case of low power \nlossy networks. The processing can also be classified as edge computing at local cloud, \ngrid or mesh computing. The nodes may be mobile or of a wireless sensor network or \ncooperative distributed in peer-to-peer and ad-hoc networks. \n\nDistributed computing refers to computing and usage of resources which are distributed at \nmultiple computing environments over the Internet. The resources are logically-related, \nwhich means communicating among themselves using message passing and transparency \nconcepts, and are cooperating with each other, movable without affecting the computations \nand can be considered as one computing system (location independent). \n\nService is a software which provides the capabilities and logically grouped and encapsulated \nfunctionalities. A service is called by an application for utilising the capabilities. A service \nhas a description and discovery methods, such as advertisement for direct use or through \na service broker. The service binds to Service Level Agreement (SLA) between service \n(provider end point) and application (end point). One service can also use another service. \n\nWeb Service , according to the W3C definition, is an application identified by a URI, \ndescribed and discovered using the XML based Web-Service Description Language \n(WSDL). A web service interacts with other services and applications using XML messages \nand exchanges the objects using Internet protocols. \n\nService-oriented architecture consists of components which are implemented as independent \nservices which can be dynamically bonded and orchestrated, and which possess loosely \ncoupled configurations, while the communication between them uses messages. \nOrchestrating means a process which predefines an order of calling the services (in \nsequences and in parallel) and the data and message exchanges. \n\nWeb computing refers to computing using resources at computing environment of web \nserver(s) or web services over the Internet. \n\nGrid computing refers to computing using the pooled interconnected grid of computing \nresources and environments in place of web servers. \n\nUtility computing refers to computing using focus on service levels with optimum \namount of resources allotted when required and takes the help of pooled resources and \nenvironments for hosting applications. The applications utilise the services. \n\n2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing \n\n206 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nCloud computing refers to computing using a collection of services available over the \nInternet that deliver computational functionality on the infrastructure of a service provider \nfor connected systems and enables distributed grid and utility computing. \n\nKey Performance Indicator (KPI) refers to a set of values, usually consisting of one or more \nraw monitored values including minimum, average and maximum values specifying the \nscale. A service is expected to be fast, reliable and secure. The KPIs monitor the fulfillment \nof these objectives. For example, a set of values can relate to Quality of Service (QoS) \ncharacteristics, such as bandwidth availability, data backup capability, peak and average \nworkload handling capacity, ability to handle defined volume of demand at different \ntimes of the day, and the ability to deliver defined total volume of service. A cloud service \nshould be able to fulfill the defined minimum, average and maximum KPI values agreed \nin the SLA. \n\nLocalisation means cloud computing content usage is monitored by determining localisation \nof the QoS level and KPIs. \n\nSeamless cloud computing means during computing the content usages and computations \ncontinue without any break when the service usage moves to a location with similar QoS \nlevel and KPIs. For example, continue using same cloud platform when developer of \nsoftware shifts. \n\nElasticity denotes that an application can deploy local as well as remote applications or \nservices and release them after the application usage. The user incurs the costs as per the \nusages and KPIs. \n\nMeasurability (of a resource or service) is something which can be measured for controlling \nor monitoring and enables report of the delivery of resource or service. \n\nHomogeneity of different computing nodes in a cluster or clusters refers to integration \nwith the kernel providing the automatic migration of the processes from one to other \nhomogeneous nodes. System software on each computing node should ensure same \nstorage representation and same results of processing. 3 \n\nResilient computing refers to the ability of offering and maintaining the accepted QoS and \nKPIs in presence of the identified challenges, defined and appropriate resilience metrics, \nand protecting the service. 4 The challenges may be small to big, such as misconfiguration \nof a computing node in a network to natural disasters. An English Cambridge dictionary \ngives the meaning of resilience as the power or ability to return to the original form, \nposition, etc., after being bent, compressed or stretched. \n\nScalability in cloud services refers to the ability using which an application can deploy \nsmaller local resources as well as remotely distributed servers and resources, and then \nincrease or decrease the usage, while incurring the cost as per the usage on increasing \nscales. \n\n3 http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/practical-hetro/node3.html \n4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resilience_(network) \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n207 \n\nMaintainability \nin \ncloud services refers to the storage, applications, computing \ninfrastructure, services, data centres and servers maintenances which are responsibilities \nof the remotely connected cloud services with no costs to the user. \n\nXAAS is a software architectural concept that enables deployment and development of \napplications, and offers services using web and SOA . A computing paradigm is to integrate \ncomplex applications and services (Section 5.3.5) and use XAAS concept for deploying a \ncloud platform. 5 \n\nMultitenant cloud model refers to accessibility to a cloud platform and computing \nenvironment by multiple users who pay as per the agreed QoS and KPIs, which are \ndefined at separate SLAs with each user. Resource pooling is done by the users but each \nuses pays separately. \n\nThe following subsections describe the cloud computing paradigm and deployment \nmodels. \n\n6.2.1 \nCloud Computing Paradigm \n\nCloud computing means a collection of services available over the Internet. Cloud \ndelivers the computational functionality. Cloud computing deploys infrastructure of a \ncloud-service provider. The infrastructure deploys on a utility or grid computing or web- \nservices environment that includes network, system, grid of computers or servers or data \ncentres. \n\nJust as we\u2014users of electricity\u2014do not need to know about the source and underlying \ninfrastructure for electricity supply service, similarly, a user of computing service or \napplication need not know how the infrastructure deploys or the details of the computing \nenvironment. Just as the user does not need to know Intel processor inside a computer, \nsimilarly, the user uses the data, computing and intelligence in the cloud, as part of the \nservices. Similarly, the services are used as a utility at the cloud. \n\nCloud Platform Services \n\nCloud platform offers the following: \n\n\u25cf Infrastructure for large data storage of devices, RFIDs, industrial plant machines, \nautomobiles and device networks \n\n\u25cf Computing capabilities, such as analytics, IDE (Integrated Development Environment) \n\n\u25cf Collaborative computing and data store sharing \n\nCloud Platform Usages \n\nCloud platform usages are for connecting devices, data, APIs, applications and services, \npersons, enterprises, businesses and XAAS. \n\n5 Reader can refer to standard books for details of Cloud Computing and SOA, such as Mastering Cloud Computing by Raj- \nkumar Buyya, Christian Vecchiola and S. Thamarai Selvi from McGraw-Hill Education (2013). \n\n208 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nThe following Equation 6.1 describes a simple conceptual framework of the Internet \nCloud: \n\nInternet Cloud + Clients = User applications and services with \n\n\u2018no boundaries and no walls\u2019 \n\u2026 6.1 \n\nAn application or service executes on a platform which includes the operating system \n(OS), hardware and network. Multiple applications may initially be designed to run on \ndiversified platforms (OSs, hardware and networks). Applications and services need to \nintegrate them on a common platform and running environment. \n\nCloud storage and computing environment offers a virtualised environment , which refers \nto a running environment made to appear as one to all applications and services, but in \nfact physically two or more running environments and platforms may be present. \n\nVirtualisation \n\nA characteristic of virtualised environment is that it enables \napplications and services to execute in an independent execution \nenvironment (heterogeneous computing environment). Each one \nof them stores and executes in isolation on the same platform, \nthough in fact, it may actually execute or access to a set of \ndata centres or servers or distributed services and computing \nsystems. The applications or services which are hosted remotely \nand are accessible using the Internet can easily be deployed at a \nuser application or service in a virtualised environment, provided the Internet or other \ncommunications are present. \n\nApplications need not be aware of the platform, just Internet connectivity to the \nplatform, called cloud platform, is required. The storage is called cloud storage. The \ncomputing is called cloud computing. The services are called cloud services in line with \nthe web services which host on web servers. \n\nVirtualisation of storage means user application or service accesses physical storage using \nabstract database interface or file system or logical drive or disk drive, though in fact \nstorage may be accessible using multiple interfaces or servers. For example, Apple iCloud \noffers storage to a user or user group that enables the sharing of albums, music, videos, \ndata store, editing files and collaboration among the user group members. \n\nNetwork Function Virtualisation (NFV) means a user application or service accesses the \nresources appearing as just one network, though the network access to the resources may \nbe through multiple resources and networks. \n\nVirtualisation of server means user application accesses not only one server but in fact \naccesses multiple servers. \n\nVirtualised desktop means the user application can change and deploy multiple desktops, \nthough the access by the user is through their own computer platform (OS) that in fact \nmay be through multiple OSs and platforms or remote computers. \n\nVirtualisation enables \nprovisioning for storage, \n\nnetwork functions, \nserver and desktop in \nexecution environment \n\nof multiplatforms and \n\nservers \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n209 \n\nCloud Computing Features and Advantages \n\nEssential features of cloud storage and computing are: \n\n\u25cf On demand self-service to users for the provision of storage, computing servers, \nsoftware delivery and server time \n\n\u25cf Resource pooling in multi-tenant model \n\n\u25cf Broad network accessibility in virtualised environment to heterogeneous users, clients, \nsystems and devices \n\n\u25cf Elasticity \n\n\u25cf Massive scale availability \n\n\u25cf Scalability \n\n\u25cf Maintainability \n\n\u25cf Homogeneity \n\n\u25cf Virtualisation \n\n\u25cf Interconnectivity platform with virtualised environment for enterprises and \nprovisioning of in-between Service Level Agreements (SLAs) \n\n\u25cf Resilient computing \n\n\u25cf Advanced security \n\n\u25cf Low cost \n\nCloud Computing Concerns \n\nConcerns in usage of cloud computing are: \n\n\u25cf Requirement of a constant high-speed Internet connection \n\n\u25cf Limitations of the services available \n\n\u25cf Possible data loss \n\n\u25cf Non delivery as per defined SLA specified performance \n\n\u25cf Different APIs and protocols used at different clouds \n\n\u25cf Security in multi-tenant environment needs high trust and low risks \n\n\u25cf Loss of users\u2019 control \n\n6.2.2 \nCloud Deployment Models \n\nFollowing are the four cloud deployment models: \n\n1. Public cloud: This model is provisioned by educational \n\ninstitutions, \nindustries, \ngovernment \ninstitutions \nor \nbusinesses or enterprises and is open for public use. \n2. Private cloud: This model is exclusive for use by institutions, \n\nindustries, businesses or enterprises and is meant for private \nuse in the organisation by the employees and associated users only. \n3. Community cloud: This model is exclusive for use by a community formed by \n\ninstitutions, industries, businesses or enterprises, and for use within the community \norganisation, employees and associated users. The community specifies security and \ncompliance considerations. \n\nA cloud deployment \nmodel may be public, \nprivate, community or \n\nhybrid \n\n210 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n4. Hybrid cloud: A set of two or more distinct clouds (public, private or community) \n\nwith distinct data stores and applications that bind between them to deploy the \nproprietary or standard technology. \nCloud platform architecture is a virtualised network architecture consisting of a cluster \nof connected servers over the data centres and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between \nthem. A cloud platform controls and manages resources, and dynamically provisions \nthe networks, servers and storage. Cloud platform applications and network services \nare utility, grid and distributed services. Examples of cloud platforms are Amazon EC2, \nMicrosoft Azure, Google App Engine, Xively, Nimbits, AWS IoT, CISCO IoT, IOx and Fog, \nIBM IoT Foundation, TCS Connected Universe Platform. \n\nExample 6.1 \n\nProblem \nRecall Example 5.1 and list the features of the Microsoft cloud platform. \n\nSolution \n\nThe Microsoft cloud platform consists of: (i) Microsoft finished services and solutions; (ii) Microsoft building \nblock services (Dynamic CRM Online, Sharepoint Online; Exchange Online, dot Net, SQL, ASP dot Net, Office \nLive and Windows Live Services); (iii) Cloud infrastructure services (Windows Azure for compute, storage and \nresource management services); and (iv) Global foundation services (Hardware, networking, deployment and \noperations services). The platform includes development tools (Visual Studio, Windows server, Visual C++, \nVisual Basic, visual C# and dot Net). \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Computations need resources, computing environment and platform. \n\n\u25cf Applications and services may require multiple platforms and environments, and multisource \nresources. \n\n\u25cf The computing paradigms which are deployed for applications and services, are edge computing, \ndistributed computing, grid computing, utility computing and cloud computing. \n\n\u25cf A cloud service connects devices, data, APIs, applications, services, processes, persons, enterprises, \nbusinesses and everything as a service. \n\n\u25cf Cloud services offer a virtualised environment, needs QoSs and defined KPIs in the SLAs with the \nusers. \n\n\u25cf Features of cloud services are on demand self-service , resources pooling , network broad accessibility , \nelasticity and measurability, massive scale, scalability, maintainability, homogeneity, virtualisation, \ninterconnectivity platform, and resilient computing. \n\n\u25cf Cloud services need to provide advanced security for storage, applications, computing infrastructure, \nservices, data centres and servers at remotely connected cloud services independently at low cost. \n\n\u25cf Cloud services utilisation requires high-speed Internet connectivity. \n\n\u25cf Cloud computing deployment models are public , private , community and hybrid clouds . \n\n\u25cf Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, Xively and Nimbits are the examples of cloud \nservices. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p237_i0.png)\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n211 \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

Cloud services can be considered as \ndistribution service\u2014a service for linking the resources \n(computing functions, data store, processing functions, \nnetworks, servers and applications) and for provision of coordinating between the \nresources. Figure 6.2 shows four cloud service models and examples. \n\nCloud computing can be considered by a simple equation: \n\nCloud Computing = SaaS + Paas + IaaS + DaaS \n\u2026 6.2 \n\nSaaS means Software as a Service. The software is made available \nto an application or service on demand. SaaS is a service model \nwhere the applications or services deploy and host at the cloud, \nand are made available through the Internet on demand by the service user. The software \ncontrol, maintenance, updation to new version and infrastructure, platform and resource \nrequirements are the responsibilities of the cloud service provider. \n\nPaaS means Platform as a Service. The platform is made available to a developer of an \napplication on demand. PaaS is a service model where the applications and services \ndevelop and execute using the platform (for computing, data store and distribution \nservices) which is made available through the Internet on demand for the developer of \nthe applications. The platform, network, resources, maintenance, updation and security \nas per the developers\u2019 requirements are the responsibilities of the cloud service provider. \n\nIaaS means Infrastructure as a Service. The infrastructure (data stores, servers, data centres \nand network) is made available to a user or developer of application on demand. Developer \n\nDescribe cloud \ncomputing service \nmodels in a software \narchitectural concept, \neverything as a service \n\n(XAAS) \n\nLO 6.2 \n\nFour service models: \n\nSoftware, Platform, \nInfrastructure and Data \n\nas the Services \n\nNote: \n\u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \n\n\u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p238_i0.png)\n212 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\ninstalls the OS image, data store and application and controls them at the infrastructure. \nIaaS is a service model where the applications develop or use the infrastructure which is \nmade available through the Internet on demand on rent (pay as per use in multi-tenancy \nmodel) by a developer or user. IaaS computing systems, network and security are the \nresponsibilities of the cloud service provider. \n\nDaaS means Data as a Service. Data at a data centre is made available to a user or \ndeveloper of application on demand. DaaS is a service model where the data store or data \nwarehouse is made available through the Internet on demand on rent (pay as per use in \nmulti tenancy model) to an enterprise. The data centre management, 24\u00d77 power, control, \nnetwork, maintenance, scale up, data replicating and mirror nodes and systems as well as \nphysical security are the responsibilities of the data centre service provider. \n\nExample 6.2 \n\nProblem \nGive examples of Saas, PaaS, IaaS, DaaS service models for cloud computing. \n\nSolution \n\n\u25cf SaaS Applications of Google Docs for online office, MS Windows Live for online office applications, MS \nExchange Labs, TCS iON (Integrated IT-as-a-Service), Salesforce.com for extensible Customer Relations \nManagement (CRM) system. \n\nData Centre \n\nInfrastructure as \n\na Service \n\nPlatform as a \n\nService \n\nSoftware \nas a Service \n\nData as a \n\nService \n\nTata \nCommunications, \nGoGrid virtual \nservers, Amazon \nVirtual Servers, EC2 \n\nGoogle Docs, Office \n365, MS Windows Live, \nMS Exchange Labs., \nSalesforce.com, \nextensible CRM \n\nDB \nDB \n\nGoogle App Engine, \nMS Azure, Xively, \nNimbits, AWS IoT, \nIBM IoT Foundation, \nCisco IoT, IOx and \nFog, TCS CUP \n\nDW \n\nAmazon Web Services and \nVirtual Servers, GoGrid Virtual \nServers, EC2 , Cloud.com Open \nSource IaaS, Cisco IaaS \nSW \n\nSW \n\nSW \n\nSW \n\nFigure 6.2 \nPaaS, SaaS, IaaS and DaaS Cloud Service model \n[DW\u2014Data Warehouses; DB\u2014Databases; EC2\u2014Elastic Computing Cloud; SW\u2014Software; \nMS\u2014Microsoft; CRM\u2014Customer Customer Relations Management] \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p239_i0.png)\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n213 \n\n\u25cf PaaS SuiteFlex for business process development NetSuite tools, MS Azure for Windows applications \nprogramming and execution environment, server platforms of EC2 and GoGrid, application platforms \nof Force Com, Google App engine for scalable execution environment for web applications, and TCS \nplatform BPO solutions, Xively, Nimbits, AWS IoT, IBM IoT Foundation, Cisco IoT, IOx and Fog, TCS CUP. \n\n\u25cf IaaS infrastructure services\u2014Amazon Virtual Servers, GoGrid virtual servers, Elastic Computing Cloud \n(EC2), Cloud.com open source IaaS, TCS Transformation Solutions, Cisco IaaS, and IBM BlueCloud shared \ninfrastructure service that automate fluctuating demands for the IT resources. \n\n\u25cf DaaS Data storage platforms of Tata Communications 10 X, Apple and Cisco for the DaaS. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf A computing paradigm is Everything as a Service .

The user obtains responses \nor feeds from the application or service. An IoT cloud-based \nservice provides for data collection, data points, messages \nand calculation objects. The service also provisions for the \ngeneration and communication of alerts, triggers and feeds to the user. A server can be \ndeployed at the edges (device nodes) which communicates the feeds to the cloud service. \n\nExplain the \nusages of cloud \nplatforms for IOT \n\napplications and \nservices with the \nexamples of Xively \n(Pachube/COSM) and \n\nNimbits \n\nLO 6.3 \n\n214 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA data point generates a new data each time a new sensed \nvalue (data) is recorded. A feed means a set of data points or \nobjects or data streams or messages which generate and \ncommunicate after application of rules for filter, calculation, \ncompaction, fusion, compression, analysis or aggregation. The feed may also be for the \nalerts on the programmed triggers or alarms. The feed can be data stream generating and \ncommunicating at the present time intervals. The feed is for an application or service. \nFeeds means required data instances at predefined intervals for an application or service \nusing the push/subscribe or any other mode. \n\nExample 6.3 \n\nProblem \nA server provisions for generation and communication of data points, objects, streams, alerts, triggers and \nfeeds applying the rules for filtering and calculations. Consider streetlights Internet Example 1.2. Assume \nthat each streetlight device node generates the following data: (i) streetlightID , (ii) ambientLightCondition \naLC (= dark or daylight), (iii) trafficDensity tD (= VehiclesPassingPerSec), (iv) functionality func (= streetlight \nfunctional or nonFunctional ) which streams to the streetlights group server locally. \n\nAssume that a streetServer provides a local control and feeds the data streams to IoTStreetLightsServer \n(ILS) at a cloud. Three applications (services), central controller, Maintenance Service and Traffic_Lights_ \nControl_Service connect to the cloud for feeds of messages and alerts from an ILS hosted at the cloud. \nSuggest the data points, datastreams, triggers and feeds for the ILS at the cloud. \n\nSolution \n\nDataPoints or each streetlight are (i) aLC (= 1 or 0), (ii) trafficPresence (= 1 or 0), (iii) tD (iv) funct (= 1 \nor 0) and (v) activate . \nThe streetServer controls locally the deactivation of the individual lights when aLC = daylight and when \ntD = 0 even when a trigger activate (Central controller activates the streetlight yes or no) is received \nfrom the controller. This is an energy-saving measure. The server receives in the feeds trigger activate \nfor each streetlightID from the controller. The server feeds the controller datastreams for the (i) streetID, \nstreetServerID and streetTrafficDensity messages and (ii) streetlightID . A functionality alert feeds when the \nfunc = 0 and that means the streetlight needs maintenance. \n\nCentral controller receives the feeds from the clouds. The controller generates the following data points, \n(i) streetlightID (ii) activate (Central Controller command activate the streetlight yes or no) (iv) tD (v) func . \n\nThe controller generates the feeds as follows: \n\n1. feed_ID, streetServerID, streetlightID and activate for the streetServer \n\n2. feed_ID, streetlightID and functionality Alert for Maintenance Service. \n3. feed_ID, streetServerID and streetTrafficDensity datastream for Traffic_Lights_Control_Service. \n\nFollowing subsections describe the Xively, Nimbits and other cloud platforms as a \nservice to the users. \n\nCloud service deploys \na server instance at the \n\nIoT sensor network \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n215 \n\n6.4.1 \nIoT Cloud-based Data Collection, Storage, Computing using Xively \n\nPachube is a platform for data capture in real-time over the Internet. Cosm is a changed \ndomain name, where using a concept of console, one can monitor the feeds. Xively is the \nlatest domain name. Xively is an open source platform for Arduino which is an open- \nsource prototyping platform that provides connectivity with web deploying Internet. \n\nXively is a commercial PaaS for the IoT/M2M. 6 It is used as a data aggregator and data \nmining website often integrated into the Web of Things. Xively is an IoT PaaS for services \nand business services. The platform supports the REST, WebSockets and MQTT protocols \nand connects the devices to Xively Cloud Services. There are native SDKs for Android, \nArduino, ARM mbed, Java, PHP, Ruby and Python languages. Developers can use the \nworkflow of prototyping, deployment and management through the tools provided by \nXively. 3 \n\nXively PaaS services offers the following features: \n\n\u25cf It enables services, business services platform which connects the products, including \ncollaboration products, Rescue, Boldchat, join.me, and operations to the Internet. \n\n\u25cf Data collection in real-time over the Internet. \n\n\u25cf Data visualisation for data of connected sensors to IoT devices. \n\n\u25cf Graphical plots of collected data. \n\n\u25cf It generates alerts. \n\n\u25cf Access to historical data. \n\n\u25cf It supports Java, Python and Ruby, and Android platform. \n\n\u25cf It generates feeds which can be real-world objects of own or others. \n\n\u25cf It supports the ARM mBed TM -based, Arduino-based and other hardware-platform- \nbased IoT devices, and HTTP-based APIs which are easy to implement on device \nhardware acting as clients to Xively web services, and connect to the web service and \nsend data. \n\n\u25cf It supports REST. \nA user creates an account with Xively when deploying Xively APIs for the data collection \nand other functions. An API key from my settings is necessarily copied. \n\nXively APIs enable interface with Python, HTML5, HTML5 server, tornado, webSocket, \nwebSocket Server and WebSockets and interface with an RPC (Remote Procedure Call). \n\nDevices get an online presence. For example, an Arduino climate logging client that can \nbe accessed via a browser or mobile using Xively. Arduino is an open-source prototyping \nplatform which is based on ATmega microcontroller for embedded applications and IoT/ \nM2M. Another platform is mBed TM . It is based on ARM Cortex-microprocessors. The \nmBed TM is also for embedded applications and IoT/M2M (Chapter 8). Xively is an open \nsource platform that enables IoT devices or sensors network to connect the sensor data to \nthe web. 7,8 Xively provides services for logging, sharing and displaying sensor data of all \nkinds using an HTTP based API. \n\n6 https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-use-xively-platform-in-iot-project \n7 http://blackstufflabs.com/2011/10/08/ arduino-pachubes-api-v2/?lang=en \n8 https://developer.mbed.org/cookbook/Pachube) which is easy to implement with mbed \n\n216 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nXively is based on the concept of users, feeds, data streams, data points and triggers. \nA feed is typically a single location (e.g. a house), and data streams are of individual \nsensors associated with that location (for example, ambient lights, temperatures, power \nconsumption). \n\nPull or Push (Automatic or Manual Feed) Methods for IoT Devices Data \n\nXively provides two modes for data capture, viz. a pull method (automatic feed type) \nwhere data is collected from an http server, and a push method (manual feed type) where \ndata is written to Xively using an http client. \n\nData Formats and Structures \n\nNumber of data formats and structures enable interaction, data collection and services \nwith Xively. The support exists for JSON (Section 3.2.3), XML (Section 3.3.3) and CSV (a \ntabular, spreadsheet, excel, data numbers and text with a comma-separated values in file). \n\nPrivate and Public Data Access \n\nA free account supports up to 10 sensor feeds updated in near real time and the data is \nstored for up to 3 months. Interactive graphs provided by the service can be embedded \nonto the mobile giving the application access to data anywhere. The application can even \nuse other user\u2019s data feeds as inputs. \n\nData streams, Data points and Triggers \n\nXively enables data streams, data points and triggers. Data stream means continuous \nsensed data flow over the Internet. Data points mean data values, whereas trigger means \naction on a state change. For example, ambient light sensing below a threshold value near \na group of streetlights (Example 1.2) or data point reaching at threshold, maximum or \nminimum or set point. \n\nExample 6.4 shows create, read, update and delete data stream functions and usage of \ndata points and triggers using Xively APIs V2 API. 9 \n\nExample 6.4 \n\nProblem \nHow does Xively APIs V2 create, read, update and delete data stream? How do the APIs use data points? \nHow do the APIs use triggers? \n\nSolution \n\nFirstly the API is registered. Then a procedure is followed for data stream, data points and triggers. \nData Streams \n\nXively v2 API enables the following data stream functionalities: \n\n1. Create new datastream using POST /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/ datastreams/ <datastream_id> \n\n9 http://api.pachube.com/v2/ \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n217 \n\n2. Read a datastream using GET /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/ <datastream_id> \n3. Update a datastream using PUT /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/ <datastream_id> \n4. Delete a datastream using DELETE /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/ <datastream_id> \nEach function uses \n\n1. *@param stream_id Stream ID text. \n2. *@param value value. \n3. * @return Return code from a web server. \nData Points \nXively v2 API enables the following data point functionalities: \n\n1. Create new datapoints using POST /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/ <datastream_id>/datapoints, \n2. Read \ndatapoints \nusing \nGET \n/ \nv2/feeds/<feed_id>/ \ndatastreams/ \n<datastream_id>/ \ndatapoints/<timestamp> \n3. Update \ndatapoints \nusing \nPUT \n/v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/ \n<datastream_id>/ \ndatapoints/<timestamp> \n4. Delete datapoints using DELETE /v2/feeds/<feed_id>/datastreams/<datastream_id> \nTriggers \nXively v2 API (http://api.pachube.com/v2/) enables the following trigger functionalities: \n\n1. Creating new triggers using POST /v2/triggers \n2. Listing of all available triggers using GET /v2/triggers \n3. Reading a trigger using GET /v2/triggers/<trigger_id> \n4. Updating a trigger using PUT /v2/triggers/<trigger_id> \n5. Deleting a user using DELETE /v2/triggers/<trigger_id> \nTriggers can be a text/number, for example, Triggers_Max_Min. Trigger_id can be text/number, such \ntemperatureMax12345. \n\nCreating and Managing Feeds \n\nSensors or IoT devices network, such as a group of streetlights (Example 1.2), can feed \n(also called environment) data to Xively over the Internet. Individual devices can send the \ndata streams for the sensed parameters to Xively over Internet. \n\nVisualising Data \n\nXively is a platform which captures data over the Internet in real time and provides \ngraphing, alerts and historical data access. Xively enables visualising data of feeds and \ndata streams. Xively allows the manual as well as automatic feeds. \n\nFollowing Example 6.5 shows the usage of Xively v2 API. \n\nExample 6.5 \n\nProblem \nHow do the feeds create, list, read, update and delete using the Xively API V2? How do the users create, \nlist, read, update and delete using the Xively v2 API? \n\n218 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSolution \n\nXively v2 API enables the following feed functionalities: \n\n1. Creating new feed using POST /v2/feeds. \n\n2. Listing of all available feeds using GET /v2/feeds \n3. Reading feed using GET /v2/feeds/<feed_id> \n\n4. Update a feed using PUT /v2/feeds/<feed_id> \n5. Delete a feed: DELETE /v2/feeds/<feed_id> \nFeed_id can be a text/number, for example, streetlights_group12345. Feeds can be text/number, such \nstreet_lightsFeed. \n\nXively v2 API (http://api.pachube.com/v2/) enables the following user functionalities: \n\n1. Creating new users using POST /v2/users \n\n2. Listing of all available users using GET /v2/users \n\n3. Reading user using GET /v2/users/<user_id> \n\n4. Update a user using PUT /v2/users/<user_id> \n5. Delete a user using DELETE /v2/users/<user_id> \n\nUsers can be for example, Controllers_Monitors. User_id can be text or number, such controller12345. \n\n6.4.2  IoT Cloud-based Data Collection, Storage and Computing Services \n\nUsing Nimbits \n\nNimbits enables IoT on an open source distributed cloud. Nimbits cloud PaaS deploys \nan instance of Nimbits Server at the device nodes. Nimbits functions as an M2M system \ndata store, data collector and logger with access to historical data. Nimbits architecture is \na cloud-based Google App Engine. Nimbits server is a class hierarchy com.nimbits.server. \nsystem.ServerInfo of java.lang.Object. Nimbits PaaS services offer the following features: \n\n\u25cf Edge computing locally on embedded systems, built up of local applications. It runs \nthe rules and pushes important data up to the cloud running when connected over \nInternet and an instance of Nimbits Server hosts at the device nodes which is then \nenabled. \n\n\u25cf It supports multiple programming languages, including Arduino, new Arduino \nlibrary, push functions from Arduino cloud, JavaScript, HTML or the Nimbits.io Java \nlibrary. \n\n\u25cf Nimbits server functions as a backend platform. Nimbits data point can relay data \nbetween the software systems, or hardware devices such as Arduino, using the cloud \nas a backend. \n\n\u25cf An open source Java library called nimbits.io enables easy development of JAVA, web \nand Android solutions (Nimbits data, alerts, messages on mobile). \n\n\u25cf It provides a rule engine for connecting sensors, persons and software to the cloud \nand one another. Rules can be for calculations, statistics, email alerts, xmpp messages \n(Section 3.3.3), push notifications and more. \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n219 \n\n\u25cf It provides a data logging service and access, and stores the historical data points and \ndata objects. \n\n\u25cf Storage in any format that can be serialised into a string, such as JSON or XML. \n\n\u25cf It filters the noise and important changes sent to another larger central instance. \n\n\u25cf It processes a specific type of data and can store it. \n\n\u25cf Time- or geo-stamping of the data. \n\n\u25cf Nimbits clients provide over Internet, data collection in real time, charts, chart and \ngraphical plots of collected data and data entry. \n\n\u25cf Data visualisation for data of connected sensors to IoT devices. \n\n\u25cf Supports the alerts subscription, generation and sending in real time over the Internet. \n\n\u25cf It creates streams of data objects and stores them in a data point series. \n\n\u25cf Data accessibility and monitoring from anywhere, and is used to shape the behaviour \nof connected devices and software. \n\n\u25cf It supports the mBed TM , Arduino, Raspberry Pi based and other hardware platform \nbased IoT devices. \n\n\u25cf Web service APIs are easy to implement on device hardware acting as clients to \nNimbits web services, and connect to the web service and send data. \n\n\u25cf It deploys software on Google App Engine, any J2EE server on Amazon EC2 or on a \nRaspberry Pi. \nFigure 6.3 shows connected devices, sensor nodes, network data points, Nimbits server, \ndeployment at the device network nodes, and networked with the Nimbits Server (PaaS, \nSaaS and IaaS services) at cloud for applications and services. \n\nArchitecture shown in Figure 6.3 shows a NimbitsServerL which deploys at each device \nnode and is an instance of the NimbitsSeverS at the cloud. Each NimbitsServerL of the \ndevice node generates the calculation objects for device nodes. \n\nEach node also hosts an XMPPServerL, an instance of the XMPPSeverC at the cloud. \nXMPPServerL deploys at each device node and generates the data feed channels for the \nXMPP messages and alerts.Each XMPPServerL sends feeds to XMPPSeverC. \n\nData Points \n\nA data point means a collected value of a sensor in a group of sensors. Data points organise \nthe data in a number of ways. For example, points can have child points (child points \nmean subpoints; for example, if light level is a data point then light on or off is a child \npoint and light level above or below the threshold can be another child point.) \n\nPoints can be in the folders. The folders can go as deep as like in a tree (Tree means \na folder having several subfolders, a subfolder having several subfolders, till the leaf \nsubfolder.) \n\nAny type of document can upload and organise them with the points. Files can be \nshared publicly or with the connections. \n\nA subscription data feed is a special point for each user that logs system messages, \nevents, alerts from other points which are subscribed by a service and more. \n\n220 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nData Channels \n\nA user can create a data feed channel which shows the system events and messages that \nalso shows data alerts which are subscribed to show up in the feed. The user can subscribe \nto the data point of other users also, and configure the subscription(s) to send messages to \nthe feed. The user can observe the idle, high or low alerts here in real time. The user data \nfeed is just another Nimbits data point. \n\nIoT/M2M Local Data Collection + \nStorage + Nimbits Server L (an image) \n\nIoT/M2M \n\n.. \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork/ \n\nNode \n\nInternet Firewall \n\nNimbits \nServer L \n\nand \nXMPP \nServer L \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork/ \n\nNode \n\nDevice/ \n\nSensor \nNetwork/ \n\nNode \n\nFeeds \n\n1.

Nimbits 3.8.10 includes H2 database \nengine. H2 is Java SQL database. APIs are in pure Java, The main features of H2 are: \n\n\u25cf Very fast, open source, JDBC API \n\n\u25cf Embedded and server modes; in-memory databases \n\n\u25cf Encrypted database \n\n\u25cf ODBC driver \n\n\u25cf Full text search \n\n\u25cf Multi-version concurrency \n\n\u25cf Browser-based console application \n\n\u25cf Small footprint (around 1.5 MB jar file size) \nMySQL is not in pure Java and have no provisions for in-memory or encrypted \ndatabases. Footprint (DLL) is nearly 4 MB. (JAR means Java archive while DLL stands for \ndynamically linked library.) \n\nSecurity Tokens \n\nNimbits 3.9.6 provides security tokens in a new way. \n\nBreakthrough Performance and Data Integrity \n\nNimbits server 3.9.10 version launched in June 2015 provisions for the breakthrough \nperformance and data integrity. \n\nAlerts \n\nA filter means applying some rule to get new data for a data point. The filter item in the \ntree called \u201cah\u201d is for XMPP alerts (Section 3.3.3). A user application can now have many \nJIDs (Jabber IDs) for a single point\u2014alerts and messages can be sent over XMPP using the \ncustom JID of points. \n\nJabbing \n\nJabbing means pushing the alerts or messages down quickly or pushing repeatedly. Each \ntype of alert or message is assigned a Jabber ID, called JID. Each JID consists of three \nmain parts, viz. the node identifier (optional), domain identifier (required) and resource \nidentifier (optional). A JID is written in notations as <JID>:= [<node>\u201d@\u201d]<domain>[\u201c/\u201d<r \nesource>. \n\nSubscriptions \n\nA user can create many subscriptions for a single point. It may subscribe to one of the \npoints, other user, or anyone\u2019s public point to get the alerts. The user gets alerts when the \npoint goes into an alarm state, or receives new data. Alarm state means reaching preset \nvalue. For example, a pressure boiler reaching critical pressure necessitating action or \nwater reaching boiling point necessitating action. \n\n222 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSubscriptions are alternative to the configurations of alert (an alert-configuration \nmeans specifying when a point became idle, high, low using the point property menu). \nA subscription to a point creates on configuring the subscription\u2014how an application \nis programmed to get alerts (XMPP, Twitter, Email or other) and what events trigger the \nalert (new data, high or other alerts). Refer to a tutorial. 11 \n\nExample 6.6 for Internet of ACVMs clarifies the data points, child points for the \nsystem events and messages, subscriptions, JIDs for the alerts to XMPP server and \nsubscriptions to NimbitsServerC at the cloud. It assumes the architecture shown in \nFigure 6.3. \n\nExample 6.6 \n\nProblem \nConsider Internet of Automatic Chocolate Vending Machines (ACVMs) (Examples 5.1, 5.3 and 5.8). Assume \nthat each ACVM device nodes generates the following data points, child points and further children up to \nthe leaf and summary points. \nSuggest the data points and child points for the system events and messages, subscriptions for the alerts \nto XMPP server and subscriptions to NimbitsServerC at the cloud. \n\nSolution \n\nData generated on each ACVM is (i) ACVM_ID for machine Id, (ii) TimeDate (iii) ActiveStatus , (iv) to (viii) \nChocFl1Sold , ChocFl2Sold , ChocFl3Sold , ChocFl4Sold , ChocFl5Sold , each time a chocolate sells among five \nflavours Fl1, Fl2, Fl3, Fl4 and Fl5. \n\nData Points for each ACVM are (1) ACVM_ID , (2) TimeDate (3) ChocolateUnsold and (4) ChocolateReqPending \nfor number of chocolates requested and pending filling at the machine. Data point can possess a number of \nchild points and a child point can have further children in a tree format. \n\nChild points are as follows: \n\n\u25cf Child points of each (1) ACVM_ID are (1.1) Region , (1.2) Address , (1.3) Installation date , (1.4) \nMaintenanceSchedule, (1.5) Fill Service address , and (1.6) ActiveStatus (for ACVM status = active or \ninactive), and (1.7) ACVM_Nodedomainadress. \n\n\u25cf Child points of (2) TimeDate are (2.1) to (2.5) HourOnDate, DayOnDate, WeekOnDate, MonthOnDate, \nand YearOnDate for which hour, which day (1 st day, 2 nd day, \u2026, or 365 th day), which week (1 st week, \n2 nd week, \u2026, or 52 nd week), which month (1 st month or 2 nd month \u2026), and which year (1 st year or 2 nd \n\nyear, \u2026). \n\n\u25cf ChildPoints of (3) ChocolateUnsold are (3.1) to (3.5) ChocFl1UnSold, ChocFl2UnSold, ChocFl3Sold, \nChocFl4unSold, ChocFl5UnSold for unsold flavour of each chocolate flavour. \n\n\u25cf ChildPoints of (4) ChocolateReqPending are (4.1) to (4.5) ChocFl1ReqPending, ChocFl2ReqPending, \nChocFl3ReqPending, ChocFl4ReqPending, ChocFl5ReqPending, for each chocolate flavour requested and \npending from fill service. \n\n\u25cf A child point can have further children in a tree format. ChildLeafPoints are as follows: \n\n\u25cf ChildLeafPoints of (1.4) MaintenanceSchedule are (1.4.1) Last_MaintenaceDate, and (1.4.2) Next_ \nPreventive_Maintenance_Date for last and next preventive maintenance dates. \n\n11 http://nimbits.blogspot.in/. \n\nData Collection, Storage and Computing Using a Cloud Platform \n223 \n\n\u25cf ChildLeafPoints of (1.6) ActiveStatus are (1.6.1 to 1.6.5) ChocolateFl1Present, ChocolateFl2Present \nChocolateFl3Present, ChocolateFl4Present and ChocolateFl5Present for the number of each chocolate \nflavour present. \n\nAn application can have many subscriptions to a point. It may subscribe to another \nuser\u2019s point to which the user is connected or find a point using the search engine on \nnimbits.com, or may subscribe to a public point from another user who is not even known. \n\nSummary point \n\nA user creates a summary point which can compute averages, minimum, maximum, \nstandard deviations, variance and sums of another point on a specific time interval basis. \n\nCalculations \n\nA user can create calculation objects for a point. The objects can organise in a tree and a \nuser can apply many formulas for a single data point. For example, in temperature sensor \ndata point, one formula is for increase over the last value while the other is for increase \nover a normal value, each time a new temperature data point is recorded. \n\nExample 6.7 for Internet of ACVMs clarifies the summary points, data feed channels \nfor the system events and messages, subscriptions, JIDs for the alerts to XMPP server and \nsubscriptions to NimbitsServerC at the cloud. It assumes the architecture shown in Figure \n6.3. \n\nExample 6.7 \n\nProblem \nNimbits ServerL generates the calculation objects. XMPPServerL registers for the subscriptions of the \nresources (messages and alerts). XMPPServerC receives the data channel feeds the events and messages \nfrom the multiple instances of XMPPServerL for the ACVM nodes for the device nodes at different addresses. \nEach NimbitsServerL sends data channel feeds to the NimbitsServerC and XMPPServerC at the Cloud. \nAn application connects to the NimbitsServerC at the cloud service. Nimbits Client of the application sends \nsubscriptions for the events and messages to XMPPServerC. \nRefer to Example 6.6. Suggest the summary points, data feed channels for the system events and messages, \nsubscriptions for the alerts to XMPP server and subscriptions to NimbitsServerC at the cloud. \n\nSolution \n\nSummary points are generated from the DataPoints at the ACVM device nodes itself. Summary points \nare as follows: (s1) ACVM_ID, (s2) HourDate, (s3.1 to s3.5) Fl1HourlySell, Fl2HourlySell, Fl3HourlySell, \nFl4HourlySell, and Fl5HourlySell, summary points communicates to NimbitsServerL through data feed \nchannel every hour. \nCalculation Objects are the calculated objects at the NimbitsServerL, an instance of Nimbits Server S at the \ncloud. CalculationObjects deploys the data channel feeds received for the summary points from the device \nnodes. \n\nConsider a calculation object c . Each calculation object has following resources: \n\n1. ( c. 1) ACVM_ID, ( c. 1.1) ACVM_Node_domainAddress. \n\n224 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n2. ( c. 2) HourDate, and ( c. 2.1 to c. 2.1.5) Fl1FillHourlyStatus, Fl1FillHourlyStatus, Fl1FillHourlyStatus, \n\nFl1FillHourlyStatus, Fl1FillHourlyStatus for the percentage of chocolates of each flavour remaining \nunsold at the CVM with respect to maximum fill. \n\n3. ( c. 3) DayDate, and ( c. 3.1 to c. 3.5) are Fl1DaySell, Fl2DaySell, Fl3DaySell, Fl4DaySell, and Fl5DaySell \n\nfor daily sell of each ACVM. \n\n4. ( c. 3.6 to c. 3.10) are Fl1DaySellAmounnt, Fl2DaySellAmount, Fl3DaySellAmount, Fl4DaySellAmount, \n\nand Fl5DaySellAmount for daily sell amount collected, and ( c. 3.11) DayTotalSellAmount. \n\n5. ( c. 4) WeekDate, ( c. 4.1 to c. 4.5) WeeklyTotalFl1SellAmount\u2026.. to WeeklyTotalFl5SellAmount for the \n\namount of Sell of each ACVM flavours in one week, and ( c. 4.6) WeekTotalSellAmount. \n\n6. ( c. 5) MonthDate, ( c. 5.1 to c. 5.5) MonthlyTotalFl1SellAmount, \u2026.. to MonthlyTotalFl5SellAmount for \n\nthe amount of Sell of each ACVM flavours in one month, and (c5.6) MonthlyTotalSellAmount. \n\n7. ( c. 6) YearDate, ( c. 6.1) to ( c. 6.5) YearlyTotalFl1SellAmount, \u2026\u2026to YearlyTotalFl1SellAmount for the \n\namount of Sell of each ACVM flavours in one year, and (c6.6) YearTotalSellAmount. \n\nData feed channel communicates the system events and messages, subscriptions and XMPP alerts. \nSubscription is for the resources at the JIDs. A JID is <JID>:= ACVM_ID@ ACVM_Node_domainAddress/ \n<resourceName>. \n\nNimbits clients at applications subscribe to the data feed channels for the XMPPServerS. Following alerts \ngenerates on subscriptions to XMPPServerL \n\n1. When (1.6) ActiveStatus (for ACVM status = active or inactive) = 0 due to some ACVM device node \n\nfunctioning problem. \n\n2.
