If you run the \nprogram again, it starts with a clean slate. \n\nOther programs are persistent : they run for a long time (or all the time); they keep at least \nsome of their data in permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and if they shut down \nand restart, they pick up where they left off. \n\nExamples of persistent programs are operating systems, which run pretty much whenever \na computer is on, and web servers, which run all the time, waiting for requests to come in \non the network. \n\nOne of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data is by reading and writing \ntext \ufb01les. We have already seen programs that read text \ufb01les; in this chapter we will see \nprograms that write them. \n\nAn alternative is to store the state of the program in a database. In this chapter I will present \na simple database and a module, pickle , that makes it easy to store program data. \n\n14.2 \nReading and writing \n\nA text \ufb01le is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent medium like a hard drive, \n\ufb02ash memory, or CD-ROM. We saw how to open and read a \ufb01le in Section 9.1. \n\nTo write a \ufb01le, you have to open it with mode 'w' as a second parameter: \n\n>>> fout = open('output.txt', 'w') \n\n138 \nChapter 14. Files \n\nIf the \ufb01le already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh, \nso be careful! If the \ufb01le doesn\u2019t exist, a new one is created. \n\nopen returns a \ufb01le object that provides methods for working with the \ufb01le. The write \nmethod puts data into the \ufb01le. \n\n>>> line1 = \"This here's the wattle,\\n\" \n>>> fout.write(line1) \n24 \n\nThe return value is the number of characters that were written. The \ufb01le object keeps track \nof where it is, so if you call write again, it adds the new data to the end of the \ufb01le. \n\n>>> line2 = \"the emblem of our land.\\n\" \n>>> fout.write(line2) \n24 \n\nWhen you are done writing, you should close the \ufb01le. \n\n>>> fout.close() \n\nIf you don\u2019t close the \ufb01le, it gets closed for you when the program ends. \n\n14.3 \nFormat operator \n\nThe argument of write has to be a string, so if we want to put other values in a \ufb01le, we \nhave to convert them to strings. The easiest way to do that is with str : \n\n>>> x = 52 \n>>> fout.write(str(x)) \n\nAn alternative is to use the format operator , % . When applied to integers, % is the modulus \noperator. But when the \ufb01rst operand is a string, % is the format operator. \n\nThe \ufb01rst operand is the format string , which contains one or more format sequences , \nwhich specify how the second operand is formatted. The result is a string. \n\nFor example, the format sequence '%d' means that the second operand should be format- \nted as a decimal integer: \n\n>>> camels = 42 \n>>> '%d' % camels \n'42' \n\nThe result is the string '42' , which is not to be confused with the integer value 42 . \n\nA format sequence can appear anywhere in the string, so you can embed a value in a \nsentence: \n\n>>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels \n'I have spotted 42 camels.' \n\nIf there is more than one format sequence in the string, the second argument has to be a \ntuple. Each format sequence is matched with an element of the tuple, in order. \n\nThe following example uses '%d' to format an integer, '%g' to format a \ufb02oating-point num- \nber, and '%s' to format a string: \n\n>>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels') \n'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.' \n\n14.4. Filenames and paths \n139 \n\nThe number of elements in the tuple has to match the number of format sequences in the \nstring. Also, the types of the elements have to match the format sequences: \n\n>>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2) \nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string \n>>> '%d' % 'dollars' \nTypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str \n\nIn the \ufb01rst example, there aren\u2019t enough elements; in the second, the element is the wrong \ntype. \n\nFor more information on the format operator, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/ \nstdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting . \nA more powerful alternative is \nthe string format method, which you can read about at https://docs.python.org/3/ \nlibrary/stdtypes.html#str.format . \n\n14.4 \nFilenames and paths \n\nFiles are organized into directories (also called \u201cfolders\u201d). Every running program has a \n\u201ccurrent directory\u201d, which is the default directory for most operations. For example, when \nyou open a \ufb01le for reading, Python looks for it in the current directory. \n\nThe os module provides functions for working with \ufb01les and directories (\u201cos\u201d stands for \n\u201coperating system\u201d). os.getcwd returns the name of the current directory: \n\n>>> import os \n>>> cwd = os.getcwd() \n>>> cwd \n'/home/dinsdale' \n\ncwd stands for \u201ccurrent working directory\u201d. The result in this example is /home/dinsdale , \nwhich is the home directory of a user named dinsdale . \n\nA string like '/home/dinsdale' that identi\ufb01es a \ufb01le or directory is called a path . \n\nA simple \ufb01lename, like memo.txt is also considered a path, but it is a relative path because \nit relates to the current directory. If the current directory is /home/dinsdale , the \ufb01lename \nmemo.txt would refer to /home/dinsdale/memo.txt . \n\nA path that begins with / does not depend on the current directory; it is called an absolute \npath . To \ufb01nd the absolute path to a \ufb01le, you can use os.path.abspath : \n\n>>> os.path.abspath('memo.txt') \n'/home/dinsdale/memo.txt' \n\nos.path provides other functions for working with \ufb01lenames and paths. For example, \nos.path.exists checks whether a \ufb01le or directory exists: \n\n>>> os.path.exists('memo.txt') \nTrue \n\nIf it exists, os.path.isdir checks whether it\u2019s a directory: \n\n>>> os.path.isdir('memo.txt') \nFalse \n>>> os.path.isdir('/home/dinsdale') \nTrue \n\n140 \nChapter 14. Files \n\nSimilarly, os.path.isfile checks whether it\u2019s a \ufb01le. \n\nos.listdir returns a list of the \ufb01les (and other directories) in the given directory: \n\n>>> os.listdir(cwd) \n['music', 'photos', 'memo.txt'] \n\nTo demonstrate these functions, the following example \u201cwalks\u201d through a directory, prints \nthe names of all the \ufb01les, and calls itself recursively on all the directories. \n\ndef walk(dirname): \nfor name in os.listdir(dirname): \npath = os.path.join(dirname, name) \n\nif os.path.isfile(path): \nprint(path) \nelse: \nwalk(path) \n\nos.path.join takes a directory and a \ufb01le name and joins them into a complete path. \n\nThe os module provides a function called walk that is similar to this one but more ver- \nsatile. \nAs an exercise, read the documentation and use it to print the names of the \n\ufb01les in a given directory and its subdirectories. \nYou can download my solution from \nhttps://thinkpython.com/code/walk.py . \n\n14.5 \nCatching exceptions \n\nA lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write \ufb01les. If you try to open a \ufb01le \nthat doesn\u2019t exist, you get an FileNotFoundError : \n\n>>> fin = open('bad_file') \nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'bad_file' \n\nIf you don\u2019t have permission to access a \ufb01le: \n\n>>> fout = open('/etc/passwd', 'w') \nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/passwd' \n\nAnd if you try to open a directory for reading, you get \n\n>>> fin = open('/home') \nIsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home' \n\nTo avoid these errors, you could use functions like os.path.exists and os.path.isfile , \nbut it would take a lot of time and code to check all the possibilities (if \u201c Errno 21 \u201d is any \nindication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong). \n\nIt is better to go ahead and try\u2014and deal with problems if they happen\u2014which is exactly \nwhat the try statement does. The syntax is similar to an if...else statement: \n\ntry: \nfin = open('bad_file') \nexcept: \nprint('Something went wrong.') \n\n14.6. Databases \n141 \n\nPython starts by executing the try clause. If all goes well, it skips the except clause and \nproceeds. If an exception occurs, it jumps out of the try clause and runs the except clause. \n\nHandling an exception with a try statement is called catching an exception. In this exam- \nple, the except clause prints an error message that is not very helpful. In general, catching \nan exception gives you a chance to \ufb01x the problem, or try again, or at least end the program \ngracefully. \n\n14.6 \nDatabases \n\nA database is a \ufb01le that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a \ndictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between \na database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so \nit persists after the program ends. \n\nThe module dbm provides an interface for creating and updating database \ufb01les. As an \nexample, I\u2019ll create a database that contains captions for image \ufb01les. \n\nOpening a database is similar to opening other \ufb01les: \n\n>>> import dbm \n>>> db = dbm.open('captions', 'c') \n\nThe mode 'c' means that the database should be created if it doesn\u2019t already exist. The \nresult is a database object that can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary. \n\nWhen you create a new item, dbm updates the database \ufb01le. \n\n>>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.' \n\nWhen you access one of the items, dbm reads the \ufb01le: \n\n>>> db['cleese.png'] \nb'Photo of John Cleese.' \n\nThe result is a bytes object , which is why it begins with b . A bytes object is similar to a \nstring in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important, \nbut for now we can ignore it. \n\nIf you make another assignment to an existing key, dbm replaces the old value: \n\n>>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.' \n>>> db['cleese.png'] \nb'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.' \n\nSome dictionary methods, like keys and items , don\u2019t work with database objects. But \niteration with a for loop works: \n\nfor key in db.keys(): \nprint(key, db[key]) \n\nAs with other \ufb01les, you should close the database when you are done: \n\n>>> db.close() \n\n142 \nChapter 14. Files \n\n14.7 \nPickling \n\nA limitation of dbm is that the keys and values have to be strings or bytes. If you try to use \nany other type, you get an error. \n\nThe pickle module can help. It translates almost any type of object into a string suitable \nfor storage in a database, and then translates strings back into objects. \n\npickle.dumps takes an object as a parameter and returns a string representation ( dumps is \nshort for \u201cdump string\u201d): \n\n>>> import pickle \n>>> t = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> pickle.dumps(t) \nb'\\x80\\x03]q\\x00(K\\x01K\\x02K\\x03e.' \n\nThe format isn\u2019t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be easy for pickle to interpret. \npickle.loads (\u201cload string\u201d) reconstitutes the object: \n\n>>> t1 = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> s = pickle.dumps(t1) \n>>> t2 = pickle.loads(s) \n>>> t2 \n[1, 2, 3] \n\nAlthough the new object has the same value as the old, it is not (in general) the same object: \n\n>>> t1 == t2 \nTrue \n>>> t1 is t2 \nFalse \n\nIn other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect as copying the object. \n\nYou can use pickle to store non-strings in a database. In fact, this combination is so com- \nmon that it has been encapsulated in a module called shelve . \n\n14.8 \nPipes \n\nMost operating systems provide a command-line interface, also known as a shell . Shells \nusually provide commands to navigate the \ufb01le system and launch applications. For exam- \nple, in Unix you can change directories with cd , display the contents of a directory with ls , \nand launch a web browser by typing (for example) firefox . \n\nAny program that you can launch from the shell can also be launched from Python using \na pipe object , which represents a running program. \n\nFor example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the contents of the current di- \nrectory in long format. You can launch ls with os.popen 1 : \n\n>>> cmd = 'ls -l' \n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd) \n\n1 popen is deprecated now, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using the subprocess \nmodule. But for simple cases, I \ufb01nd subprocess more complicated than necessary. So I am going to keep using \npopen until they take it away. \n\n14.9. Writing modules \n143 \n\nThe argument is a string that contains a shell command. The return value is an object that \nbehaves like an open \ufb01le. You can read the output from the ls process one line at a time \nwith readline or get the whole thing at once with read : \n\n>>> res = fp.read() \n\nWhen you are done, you close the pipe like a \ufb01le: \n\n>>> stat = fp.close() \n>>> print(stat) \nNone \n\nThe return value is the \ufb01nal status of the ls process; None means that it ended normally \n(with no errors). \n\nFor example, most Unix systems provide a command called md5sum that reads the contents \nof a \ufb01le and computes a \u201cchecksum\u201d. You can read about MD5 at http://en.wikipedia. \norg/wiki/Md5 . This command provides an ef\ufb01cient way to check whether two \ufb01les have \nthe same contents. The probability that different contents yield the same checksum is very \nsmall (that is, unlikely to happen before the universe collapses). \n\nYou can use a pipe to run md5sum from Python and get the result: \n\n>>> filename = 'book.tex' \n>>> cmd = 'md5sum ' + filename \n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd) \n>>> res = fp.read() \n>>> stat = fp.close() \n>>> print(res) \n1e0033f0ed0656636de0d75144ba32e0 \nbook.tex \n>>> print(stat) \nNone \n\n14.9 \nWriting modules \n\nAny \ufb01le that contains Python code can be imported as a module. For example, suppose \nyou have a \ufb01le named wc.py with the following code: \n\ndef linecount(filename): \ncount = 0 \nfor line in open(filename): \ncount += 1 \nreturn count \n\nprint(linecount('wc.py')) \n\nIf you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the \ufb01le, which is 7. \nYou can also import it like this: \n\n>>> import wc \n7 \n\nNow you have a module object wc : \n\n>>> wc \n<module 'wc' from 'wc.py'> \n\n144 \nChapter 14. Files \n\nThe module object provides linecount : \n\n>>> wc.linecount('wc.py') \n7 \n\nSo that\u2019s how you write modules in Python. \n\nThe only problem with this example is that when you import the module it runs the test \ncode at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it de\ufb01nes new functions but it \ndoesn\u2019t run them. \n\nPrograms that will be imported as modules often use the following idiom: \n\nif __name__ == '__main__': \nprint(linecount('wc.py')) \n\n__name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is running \nas a script, __name__ has the value '__main__' ; in that case, the test code runs. Otherwise, \nif the module is being imported, the test code is skipped. \n\nAs an exercise, type this example into a \ufb01le named wc.py and run it as a script. Then run \nthe Python interpreter and import wc . What is the value of __name__ when the module is \nbeing imported? \n\nWarning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does nothing. It \ndoes not re-read the \ufb01le, even if it has changed. \n\nIf you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload , but it can be \ntricky, so the safest thing to do is restart the interpreter and then import the module again. \n\n14.10 \nDebugging \n\nWhen you are reading and writing \ufb01les, you might run into problems with whitespace. \nThese errors can be hard to debug because spaces, tabs and newlines are normally invisible: \n\n>>> s = '1 2\\t 3\\n 4' \n>>> print(s) \n1 2 \n3 \n4 \n\nThe built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an argument and returns a string \nrepresentation of the object. For strings, it represents whitespace characters with backslash \nsequences: \n\n>>> print(repr(s)) \n'1 2\\t 3\\n 4' \n\nThis can be helpful for debugging. \n\nOne other problem you might run into is that different systems use different characters to \nindicate the end of a line. Some systems use a newline, represented \\n . Others use a return \ncharacter, represented \\r . Some use both. If you move \ufb01les between different systems, \nthese inconsistencies can cause problems. \n\nFor most systems, there are applications to convert from one format to another. You can \n\ufb01nd them (and read more about this issue) at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline . \nOr, of course, you could write one yourself. \n\n14.11. Glossary \n145 \n\n14.11 \nGlossary \n\npersistent: Pertaining to a program that runs inde\ufb01nitely and keeps at least some of its \ndata in permanent storage. \n\nformat operator: An operator, % , that takes a format string and a tuple and generates a \nstring that includes the elements of the tuple formatted as speci\ufb01ed by the format \nstring. \n\nformat string: A string, used with the format operator, that contains format sequences. \n\nformat sequence: A sequence of characters in a format string, like %d , that speci\ufb01es how a \nvalue should be formatted. \n\ntext \ufb01le: A sequence of characters stored in permanent storage like a hard drive. \n\ndirectory: A named collection of \ufb01les, also called a folder. \n\npath: A string that identi\ufb01es a \ufb01le. \n\nrelative path: A path that starts from the current directory. \n\nabsolute path: A path that starts from the topmost directory in the \ufb01le system. \n\ncatch: To prevent an exception from terminating a program using the try and except state- \nments. \n\ndatabase: A \ufb01le whose contents are organized like a dictionary with keys that correspond \nto values. \n\nbytes object: An object similar to a string. \n\nshell: A program that allows users to type commands and then executes them by starting \nother programs. \n\npipe object: An object that represents a running program, allowing a Python program to \nrun commands and read the results. \n\n14.12 \nExercises \n\nExercise 14.1. Write a function called sed that takes as arguments a pattern string, a replacement \nstring, and two \ufb01lenames; it should read the \ufb01rst \ufb01le and write the contents into the second \ufb01le \n(creating it if necessary). If the pattern string appears anywhere in the \ufb01le, it should be replaced \nwith the replacement string. \n\nIf an error occurs while opening, reading, writing or closing \ufb01les, your program should catch the \nexception, print an error message, and exit. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ sed. \npy . \nExercise 14.2. If you download my solution to Exercise 12.2 from https: // thinkpython. com/ \ncode/ anagram_ sets. py , you\u2019ll see that it creates a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of \nletters to the list of words that can be spelled with those letters. For example, 'opst' maps to the \nlist ['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', 'tops'] . \n\nWrite a module that imports anagram_sets and provides two new functions: store_anagrams \nshould store the anagram dictionary in a \u201cshelf\u201d; read_anagrams should look up a word and return \na list of its anagrams. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ anagram_ db. py . \n\n146 \nChapter 14. Files \n\nExercise 14.3. In a large collection of MP3 \ufb01les, there may be more than one copy of the same song, \nstored in different directories or with different \ufb01le names. The goal of this exercise is to search for \nduplicates. \n\n1. Write a program that searches a directory and all of its subdirectories, recursively, and returns \na list of complete paths for all \ufb01les with a given suf\ufb01x (like .mp3 ). Hint: os.path provides \nseveral useful functions for manipulating \ufb01le and path names. \n\n2. To recognize duplicates, you can use md5sum to compute a \u201cchecksum\u201d for each \ufb01les. If two \n\ufb01les have the same checksum, they probably have the same contents. \n\n3. To double-check, you can use the Unix command diff . \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ find_ duplicates. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 15\n\n\n",
