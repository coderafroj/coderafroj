One of the components of IoT devices is hardware which consists of a \nmicrocontroller, firmware and the sensor(s) and/or actuator(s). The automobile components \nembed the sensors and circuits consisting of microcontrollers and firmware in a car. The sensing \ndevices network communicates the status of each component and sensed data to the applications \nat an automobile service centre. An application at the centre plans the service schedule and \ngenerates alerts for the urgent actions required and the need for specific actions. \n\n232 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nActuators are devices used for actions, such as switching ON a set of streetlights or delivering \na chocolate in an automatic chocolate vending machine and then communicating information on \nthe Internet for a service provider application. \n\nRFIDs and their sensors play an active role in Internet of RFIDs. RFIDs are used for identifying \nobjects using RF. Two examples of application of Internet of RFIDs are tracking parcels, goods \nand delivery, and supply chain management. \n\nWSN can be defined as \u2018a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous \ndevices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as \ntemperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different locations.\u2019 \n\n7.1 \nINTRODUCTION \n\nIoT and M2M applications need a large magnitude of data which \nis generated from a large number of devices, ATMs, sensors at \nparking slots, health devices in ICUs, machines in industrial \nplants, embedded components in automobiles, RFIDs, or wireless \nsensor networks. \n\nData is generated using sensors, embedded devices and systems at the physical layer \nin the IoT architecture. Thereafter, the data communicates through the data-link, data- \nadaptation, network, application-support and application layers to the applications of IoT. \n\nData is used for analytics, visualisation, intelligence and knowledge discovery or \ncontrols and monitoring. Control systems use the sensors for monitoring and the actuators \nfor actions. \n\nPrototyping and designing of IoT need embedded device platforms, which provide \nconnectivity to the Internet and can communicate with applications using the Internet. \nThe applications in IoT monitor and control devices, systems and machines using the \nactuators. \n\nThis chapter describes technological aspects of sensing, concepts of participatory \nsensing in M2M devices, industrial IoT and automotive IoT. It also introduces the role of \nactuators and describes details of use of RFIDs and WSNs. \n\nSection 7.2 describes sensor technology and analog and digital sensors which are used \nin IoT and M2M. Section 7.3 describes participatory sensing concept, industrial IoT and \nautomotive IoT. Section 7.4 describes use of actuators. Section 7.5 describes use of data \ncommunication protocols (UART, I2C, LIN, CAN, USB and MOST) by IoT and M2M \ndevices.

Sensors can also sense acceleration, orientation, \nlocation, vibrations or smell, organic vapours or gases. \nA microphone senses the voice and changes in the sound, and \nis used to record voice or music. \n\nA sensor converts physical energy like heat, sound, strain, \npressure, vibrations and motion into electrical energy. An \nelectronic circuit connects to the input at a sensor. The circuit \nreceives the output of the sensor. The output is according to the \nvariation in physical condition. A smart sensor includes the electronic circuit within itself, \nand includes computing and communication capabilities. \n\nThe circuit receives energy in form of variations through currents, voltages, phase- \nangles or frequencies. Analog sensors measure the variations in the parameters with \nrespect to a reference or normal condition and provide the value of sensed parameter \nafter appropriate calculations. \n\nThe change of states with respect to a reference or normal condition senses the states in \nthe form of 0s and 1s in digital sensors. \n\n7.2.1 \nSensing the Real World \n\nElectronic components can function as sensors. Sensor is an \nelectronic device in a circuit that senses a physical environment \nor condition. The sensor sends signals to an electronic circuit, \nwhich interconnects to a serial port interface at a microcontroller \nor controller or computing device. \n\nA sensor senses a specific physical condition when it exhibits a measurable change \nin a characteristic circuit parameter on the change in the specific physical condition or \nenvironment. \n\nExample of Resistive, Capacitive, Diode and Transistor-based Sensors \n\nExample 7.1 gives the characteristic circuit parameters which change with the physical \nconditions. \n\nElucidate sensor \n\ntechnology for \nsensing the real world \nusing analog and digital \n\nsensors, and \nexamples for sensing \n\ndevices for IoT \n\nand M2M \n\nLO 7.1 \n\nSensor technology uses \n\nsensors and electronic \n\ncircuits, readers and \n\ndevices \n\nSensors are electronic \ndevices that sense the \n\nphysical environment \n\n234 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nExample 7.1 \n\nProblem \nAssume R is resistance, C is capacitance, I rev is reverse saturation current in a p-n diode and I sat is saturation \ncurrent in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). How do the characteristic circuit parameters R , C , I rev and I sat , \nsense the physical environment? How are they used for measuring the surrounding condition? \n\nSolution \n\n\u25cf Resistance R , of a specially designed wire wound on a coil is used as temperature sensor. R functions as a \ncomponent. R shows variation with temperature in metal wires such as platinum. A touch-screen senses \nthe resistive variation in R with the touched position. A strain sensor resistance shows the variation in \nR with the strain. Change in R is proportional to change in length due to strain; for example, 12 cm per \n10 kilo-Ohm. A flex-sensor senses the bending on applying a force by change in R . Sensor resistance R \nvaries on flexing with the path or local deflection profile change which senses the flex. \n\nResistance of a sensor of organic solvent vapours shows measurable drop in the vapours concentration \nin the vicinity. The conductivity (reciprocal of resistance) of sensor increases depending on the vapour \nor gas concentration in the air near the sensor. Gas sensor is a metal oxide coated sensor whose \nresistance varies with vapour adsorption; for example, Sensor (TGS2620) of Figaro Company. \n\nResistance of a photo-conductor shows measurable drop in the presence of light. The conductivity \n(reciprocal of resistance) of the sensor increases depending on the radiation intensity. The sensor is \nbasically a special semiconductor sensor, which shows conductivity variation exponentially with the \nreceived light intensity. \n\n\u25cf Capacitance , C, is used as proximity sensor when the capacitance of sensing component shows variation \nwith proximity to a specific object, such as a metal part or a finger. A level sensor capacitor shows \nvariation with level of filler in a container. \n\nA touched position sensor (capacitor) shows variation when a finger touches or is in the proximity or \nvicinity to the touch position on a screen. The variation in C is as per the touched position. A position \nwhen corresponds to a menu item displayed to the user, then the selected application runs on touching. \n\n\u25cf Reverse saturation current I rev of a p - n junction diode is used as a temperature sensor when that shows \nmeasurable variations within the temperature range of the study. \n\n\u25cf A specially made p - n diode with a window-entry for radiation at the junction can be used as a photo \nsensor. The sensor functions as an incident radiation-intensity sensor when the diode reverse-saturation \ncurrent I rev shows a measurable variation with radiation energy. \n\n\u25cf A specially made BJT with a window-entry for radiation at the junction is used as a photo sensor \n(phototransistor). Saturation current I sat between collector-emitter in the BJT shows measurable \nvariation within incident infrared or light radiation intensity. \n\nA characteristic parameter of a circuit changes with the \nphysical conditions. Technology that facilitates such changes due \nto sensing is also used in mobile phone. A mobile phone can sense \nsurrounding conditions. The touchscreen of a mobile phone can \nsenses a finger touch and gestures. Smartphones have resistive \nand capacitive sensors, photodiode current-based sensors, and acceleration, gyroscope, \ntemperature and pressure sensors. The sensors enable the functioning of applications and \ngames. \n\nMobile phones use a \n\nnumber of sensors, \nsuch as finger touch \n\nand gesture via a \nsensor on touchscreen \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n235 \n\nA microcontroller is an associate computing device with a sensor circuit which calculates \nthe touched position and maps it to a user command when a resistive-based touchscreen \nis used. Then the mobile phone takes further actions as per the command. \n\nAnalog Sensors \n\nAnalog sensors use a sensor and an associated electronic analog \ncircuit. Analog sensors generate analog outputs as per the \nphysical environmental parameters, such as temperature, strain, \npressure, force, flex, vapours, magnetic field, or proximity. \nResistance of the sensing component may show measurable \nchanges with surrounding pressure or strain or magnetic field or \nhumidity. Resistance of a pressure sensor increases on pressure \nwhich creates a strain on the sensor. A flex sensor, for example, of 2.2 inch or 4.5 inch length, \nshows that its resistance across the sensor strip increases on flexing due to a changed path \nand deflection of the sensing resistor. \n\nThe measurement of analog output from a sensor circuit is performed as follows\u2014 \nthe sensor output is given to the input of a signal conditioning-cum-amplifying circuit \n(SC). The SC output is the input to an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC gives \na digital output; for example, 8 or 12 bits. This output is read using a microcontroller. \nMicrocontroller reading and computation gives the value of the sensed parameter value \nand shows the physical condition around the sensor. \n\nReading Temperature from Resistance Sensor \n\nExample 7.2 shows how an analog sensor and a sensing resistor with associated electronics \nenables the sensing and measuring of temperature. \n\nExample 7.2 \n\nProblem \nAssume an electronic circuit with a sensing component resistance as a physical object. How are temperatures \nsensed? \n\nSolution \n\nA resistor in the form of a wire or a component can be a part of the electronic circuit. Ohm\u2019s law states that \nresistance remains constant only as long as physical conditions remain the same. The resistor functions as \na sensor when its value changes measurably within the required temperature range for sensing. \n\nThe measurements can be first made using two standard or \nreference temperature points, such as 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. An equation \nor table can be prepared for the sensing component resistance R \nvalues as a function of the temperature T in \u00b0C. When changes \nare linearly related to the change in the physical environment \nthen the equation is used. When changes are nonlinearly or \n\nAnalog sensors \ngenerate analog \noutputs as per the \nphysical environmental \n\nparameters such as \ntemperature or strain \n\nAn equation or a table \n\nrelates the sensor \nresistance with the \nsensed and measured \n\nparameter value at a \ngiven physical condition \n\n236 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nexponentially related to the change in the physical environment, then use of the table is \npreferred. \n\nWhen temperature, such as of oil or coolant plate in an M2M or IoT device in an \nautomobile needs to be sensed then a simple electronic circuit uses the sensing component \nat the sensed object. The associate computing device calculates the temperature value at \nthe measuring instance. Figure 7.1 shows a circuit consisting of a resistance bridge. The \nbridge has one sensing resistor at the sensing object and three fixed (standard) resistors. \nThe figure shows a microcontroller using an electronic circuit with a port connected to sub- \ncircuits, serial port interface, ADC, signal conditioning amplifier and resistance bridge. \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nIC \nTemperature \n\nTransducer \n\nA \n\nA \u2264 \nA \u00a2 \nB \u00a2 \nB \u2264 \n\nB \n\nThermistor \n\nSerial port interface, Analog \nto digital convertor (ADC), \nSignal conditioning amplifier \nand Resistance bridge \n\nSensor \nResistance \n\nFigure 7.1 Microcontroller serial port connected to sub-circuits\u2014serial port interface, ADC, signal \n\nconditioning amplifier, resistance bridge and sensor resistance outputs A ad B. Alternatively \ncircuit connects to a thermistor output at A\u2019 and B\u2019 or IC based temperature-transducer \noutput at A\u2019\u2019 and B\u2019\u2019 \n\nA transducer induces current or voltage. The output changes as per a change in the \nphysical energy at input. An IC-based circuit for a temperature-transducer induces current \nin the output according to the heat energy, represented by the temperature. \n\nMicrocontroller is a computing device which reads the input at its ports, saves the \nreading in memory and then the reading is used for computations and communication. \n\nReading from Capacitive Sensor \n\nExample 7.3 shows how a sensing capacitor enables sensing using a capacitance bridge. \n\nExample 7.3 \n\nProblem \nAssume an electronic circuit with a sensing component capacitor as a physical object. How are the changes \nof capacitance sensed when using an electronic circuit with a sensing capacitor as a physical object? \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n237 \n\nSolution \n\nConsider two cases: \n\n1. When a metal part is present in the vicinity of a parallel plate capacitor, the capacitance C changes \n\nand proximity distance is sensed. \n2. When a finger reaches near a screen, and the screen has a metallic grid at its base, then C will change \n\ndepending upon the touched position or C varies with time when the finger is approaching towards \nthe vicinity to a menu item on the screen. \n\nC of a sensor object is a part of a capacitive bridge. The associate computing device \ncalculates the proximity distance in case 1 and touched position in case 2 as well as the \nsuccessive variations. Microcontroller is a computing device which reads the input at its \nports, saves the input at memory, and then uses the data for communication over the \nInternet. \n\nFigure 7.2 shows a circuit using a capacitance bridge. The bridge consists of the sensing \ncapacitor (object) and three fixed (standard) capacitors. The figure shows a microcontroller- \nbased electronic circuit with port connected to four sub-circuits, serial port interface, \nADC, signal conditioning amplifier, diode and capacitance bridge. \n\nMicrocontroller \nA \n\nB \nOscillator \n\nSensor \nCapacitance \n\nSerial port interface, ADC, \ndiode, Signal conditioning \namplifier, and Capacitance \nbridge \n\nFigure 7.2 Microcontroller electronic circuit; port connected to sub-circuits; serial port interface, ADC, \n\ndiode, signal conditioning amplifier and capacitance bridge, and sensor capacitance at A \nand B \n\nSerial Port Interface \n\nA serial port interface with the ADC has an advantage that the ADC 8 or 10 or 12 bit \noutput is input to the interface, and the interface sends the input to the serial port at the \nmicrocontroller. Serial port interface has just two terminals in the output (Section 7.5). \n\nAnalog to Digital Converter \n\nA microcontroller may consist of an in-circuit ADC or multiple \ninputs ADC. It processes the digital output from the in-circuit \nADC. Alternatively, a port accepts the digital input consisting of \n1s and 0s through an external ADC. An 8-bit port accepts the \n8-bit input which corresponds to 0 to 255 decimal (255 d ). The port \n\nAnalog sensor circuit \n\nconnects to a signal \nconditioner amplifier, \n\nthen to an analog to \n\ndigital converter \n\n238 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\naccepts the 12-bit input in two cycles, viz. once 8 bits and then 4 bits which correspond to 0 \nto 4096 decimal (4096 d ). The analog output from a signal conditioning amplifier connects \nto the ADC input, V in . \n\nThe decimal value of ADC digital output relates V in and is in the form of the binary \nbits at the input. The decimal value of binary bits is proportional to the ratio of analog \ninput V in and reference voltage V ref . Assume a microcontroller functions with V DD , the \nmicrocontroller power supply + ve input and V SS microcontroller power supply -ve input. \n\nAssume (V DD \u2013 V SS ) = 5 V. Half of the reference voltage = (V ref /2) is applied to ADC. Half \nreference voltage can be 1.65 V (V ref < 5V. (V ref /2) << (V DD \u2013 V SS ). \n\nAssume an ADC is of 8 bits. [2 n \u2013 1 = 255 d ] Then ADC digital output = V in \u00a5 255 d / \nV ref , because V ref is the maximum input which can be applied to the ADC which gives \nmaximum digital output, 11111111 b , which means 255 d . \n\nSampling ADC \n\nSampling means that an ADC accepts input signals at specified periodic intervals and \nconverts them into digits. The interval is set as per the signal frequency and other needs. \nThe applications of sampling ADC are many. For example, while recording voice or music, \nthe sampling ADC receives signals from the microphone for the recording sensor. \n\nSignal Conditioning Amplifier \n\nAn SC amplifies the signal at the input as well as adds or subtracts an offset voltage in \nsuch a way that minimum V in (min) and maximum V in (max) values of the sensed physical \nparameter equal to 0 V and V ref , respectively, at the SC outputs. Example 7.4 clarifies how \nto use the SC and ADC and compute the temperature. \n\nExample 7.4 \n\nProblem \nHow are the voltage inputs to ADC and signal conditioning amplifier designed when using a sensor for \ntemperature? How is the sensed temperature computed? Assume that the sensor measures temperatures \nbetween \u201310\u00b0C and +40\u00b0C. \n\nSolution \n\nOutput of the signal conditioning amplifier (SC) in the circuit shown in Figure 7.1 is set such that the \nvoltages which apply to ADC inputs are always between 0 V and V ref (reference voltage input) at the ADC. \nSince temperature range is between (T min ) and (T max ), when temperatures to be sensed are between \u201310 \u00b0C \n(T min ), and + 40\u00b0C (T max ), then the ADC input = SC output should be 0V when sensor is at \u201310 \u00b0C and input \nto ADC should be V ref when sensor is at 40\u00b0C. (T min ) and (T max ) difference is 50\u00b0C. \n\nSoftware in the microcontroller uses a predefined table or equation to compute the sensed temperature, T. \nThe table saves T = 40\u00b0C when ADC output is 255 d (= 11111111 binary). The sensed temperature is [50\u00b0C \n\u00a5 n /255 \u201310\u00b0C], when the ADC output in decimal equals n . The sensed temperature is \u201310\u00b0C when the ADC \noutput equals 0 d . \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n239 \n\nThe same approach of using SC, ADC and computations are followed not only for \ntemperature but also for other sensors, such as, strain, pressure, force, flex, vapours, \nmagnetic field or proximity distances sensors. \n\nDigital Sensors \n\nA specific electronic component or circuit gives digital output \n1 or 0 (on-off state) or output of 1s and 0s as a binary number \n(corresponding to a set of on-off states). A digital sensor uses \nthe sensor and has an associated electronic circuit which gives \ndigital output. The output 1 or 0 (1s and 0s) is read through a \nport in a microcontroller. This circuit can be used for sensing a \nsudden change in specific physical state or condition or can be used for sensing a sudden \nchange in specific set of physical states or conditions. \n\nSensing of an On-Off State \n\nA number of conditions needs detection using the concept of digital output of on-off state. \nExample 7.5 gives four cases on how to sense an on-off state, which means binary 1 and 0 \noutput for reading by a circuit or microcontroler. \n\nExample 7.5 \n\nProblem \n(a) How is the switch on state sensed? How does one-bit digital output, 1 or 0 generate? (b) How does \na streetlight sensor sense ambient light condition? (c) How does a rotating wheel state sense that it has \nreached at a specific orientation? (d) How does a linearly moving part state sense that it has reached at a \nspecific linear position? Assume that the digital output is the input of a microcontroller port. \n\nSolution \n\n(a) Figure 7.3 shows that the circuit (top left) consists of one end A of the resistance connected to \n\nground potential (negative end of the supply). The other end B connects to the end C of the switch. \nA switch can have two states on or off and gives two outputs 1 or 0. The other end D connects to the \nsupply voltage V+ (= 5V) terminal. Microcontroller port pins connect C and A. \n\nAlternative (top right) circuit is that base end, B of BJT which connects to one end of the switch. \n\nThe emitter end, E of BJT connects the ground potential. The collector end, C connects to +ve end of \nsupply Vcc (= 5V) through a resistance. The switch one end connects to the microcontroller port pin. \nMicrocontroller port pin other end connects to C. \n\nAnother alternative (bottom middle) circuit is that switch one end B connects to MOSFET (Metal- \n\nOxide Field Effect Transistor) source end S. The drain end D of MOSFET connects to the supply voltage \n+ terminal, VDD through a resistance. The gate G connects to end A of the switch. The inputs at the \nmicrocontroller port pins are from B and D. \n\nThe circuits give 1s and 0s at port pins when switch state is off and on. \n\nThe right side top circuit voltage at collector C < 0.8 V is taken as 0 and > 2.8 V is taken as 1 and \n\nVCC is at 5V . \n\nDigital sensor uses \n\nthe sensor and an \nassociated electronic \n\ndigital circuit to read \n\n1s and 0s \n\n240 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nC \n\nE \n\nB \n\nV CC \n\nResistance \n\nn-p-n \nPhoto- \nTransistor \n\nGround \nPotential \n\nLight \nor \nDark \n\nFigure 7.4 Microcontroller electronic circuit \n\nfor a streetlight environment \nambient condition sensor which \nsenses two states and generates \ntwo outputs 1 or 0 for the port pin \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nResistance \n\nV+ \n\nC \n\nC \n\nD \n\nD \n\nS \n\nG \nA \n\nB \n\nE \n\nResistance \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nMOSFET \n\nV DD \n\nResistance \n\nB \n\nB \n\nA \n\nBJT \n\non-off \n\non-off \n\non-off \n\nGround \nPotential \n\nGround \nPotential \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nV CC \n\nV SS (Ground Potential) \n\nFigure 7.3 Three microcontroller electronic circuits for sensing On and Off states on generation of \n\noutput 1 and 0 for the port pin \n\n\nThe middle bottom circuit voltage at drain D (with respect to supply terminal, VSS) less than \n\n(1/3) \u00a5 (VDD \u2013 VSS) is considered as 0 and when greater than (2/3) \u00a5 (VDD \u2013 VSS) that is taken as 1.] \n\n(b) An environment ambient condition sensor at a \n\nstreetlight senses the ambient light condition using \na phototransistor, FPT. FPT detects the environment \nambient light intensity above a threshold. \nFigure 7.4 shows a circuit. The circuit gives 1 \nin output when ambient light intensity is below \nthreshold and gives 0 in output ambient light \nintensity is above threshold. \n\n(c) A rotating wheel gives two outputs 1 or 0, when it \n\nhas a pair of LED or IR-LED (light emitting diode \nor infrared LED) and phototransistor (FPT) is on \ntwo sides of a slot in the wheel. Figure 7.5 shows \nthe circuit. The circuit gives 1 in output when a \nslot of rotating wheel reaches near the FPT on \ncompleting a rotation and gives 0 in outputs till \nthat is revolving towards the completion of the \nnext revolution. The light to FPT does not block \ntill the wheel completes the revolution. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n241 \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nC \n\nE \n\nB \nLED \n\nResistance \n\nV CC \n\nn-p-n \nPhoto- \nTransistor \n\nGround \nPotential \n\nFigure 7.5 Microcontroller electronic circuit for a rotating wheel, rotation-completion sensing which \n\nsenses two states (completion or incomplete) and generate two outputs 1 or 0 for the port \npin \n\n\nA Microcontroller port P 0 pin receives the input 1 or 0.

The values of the \nrpm and circumference of the tyre enable the computation of speed in km/hour in the automobile, as \nrotator motion converts to linear motion in the automobile. \n\n(d) A moving part reaching at a specific location is sensed as follows: The part is attached with a light \n\nblocker. When the part reaches the empty space between a pair of LED (light emitting diode) and FPT, \nthe blocker blocks the light falling on the FPT, and the circuit gives 1 in output. The circuit gives \noutput = 0 when the part is not in the vicinity and is not blocking the light to FPT. Figure 7.6 shows \nthe circuit. \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nC \n\nE \n\nGround \n\nPotential \n\nB \nLED \n\nResistance \n\nV CC \n\nn-p-n \nPhoto- \nTransistor \n\nMoving \nPart \n\nLight \nBlocker \n\nFigure 7.6 Microcontroller electronic circuit for sensing when a moving part reaches at a specific \n\nlocation and sensing two states (reached or yet to reach) and generate two outputs 1 or 0 \nfor the port pin \n\n242 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA number of other applications exist for digital on-off sensing. For example, sensing of \npresence of traffic on a street, sensing the filling of a waste container up to a certain preset \nlevel that sends an alert on the Internet to the city waste management service, sensing the \npresence of organic vapours which generates an alert when sensed, sensing gas leakage \nor fire and generating an emergency alert. \n\nSensing a Set of On-Off States \n\nA number of conditions together need detection in many \napplications. A circuit generates digital output for a set of On- \noff states. A specific electronic component or circuit gives digital \noutput, such as, a set of 4 or 8 or 16 states consisting of 1s and \n0s for sensing a set of discrete changes in a specific set of physical states or conditions. \nThe output connects to a port input of a microcontroller, which reads the input at a given \ninstance. Example 7.6 clarifies this. \n\nExample 7.6 \n\nProblem \n(a) How does an array of 8 switches generate a set of 1s and 0s? (b) How is the \u201dcommunication of a number \nof chocolates for each type of flavours that remain unsold at each instance of 10% sale of each type\u201d in \nInternet of Automatic Chocolate Vending Machines done? (c) How does the data of unoccupied parking slots \nbe identified among the number of parking slots and used in Internet of Parking Spaces? \nSolution \n\n(a) An array of 8 switches generates 8-bit input for a port. An output port pin in a microcontroller sends a \n\nsense signal = 1 and the 8 return lines give the input to the microcontroller port. The 8-bit port reads \nthe input to sense 8 on-off states of the switch. Figure 7.7(a) shows the circuit. When a keyboard is \nused, then eight sense lines and eight return lines are used to read the input and sense which key is \npressed at a given instance. \n\n(b) Assume five arrays of ten FPT-LED pairs, one for each 10% level in each chocolate filler assembly for \n\neach type of chocolate flavour. Five flavour assemblies mean fifty sensors. Each sensor generates an \non state signal 1 for 10% filled level of unsold chocolate type. When a specific flavour sells 80%, then \neight sensors give eight 1s and two 0s in an array. Total filler levels are 10 for each chocolate flavour. \nTotal sum of 1s and 0s is 80 d . Five sets of five-filler assemblies for five chocolate flavours are read \ncyclically at the preset intervals. The data of all 50-filler levels is transmitted to the Internet and then \na chocolate vending service application communicates regularly the presence of unsold chocolate \npercentages to the service. Figure 7.7(b) shows the circuit. \n(c) Assume that there are 64 parking slots. A photoconductor as a sensor for laser diode light beam block \n\ndetection can be used at each parking slot. Each sensor generates an on state signal 1 whenever a \nslot gets vacant. An array of eight slots is selected by three encoded lines from microcontroller. A \nset of eight-slots status in an array is read cyclically. Each array is cyclically selected. Data of all 64 \nslots is transmitted to the Internet and then a parking service application communicates regularly \nthe presence of vacant slots to the vehicles passing through the traffic lights nearby to the parking \nfacility.

An NTC thermistor shows negative \ntemperature coefficient which means a drop in the resistance value with rise in temperature. \n\nThermistor finds applications in home automation or in sensing the clouds. The output \nof thermistor connects to the circuit of a signal conditioning amplifier, ADC and then \nto microcontroller serial port, similar to the circuit in Figure 7.1 except that in place of a \nresistance-bridge, a thermistor circuit is used. \n\nA temperature sensor is called PTC, when it exhibits a Positive Temperature Coefficient. \nResistance value of a PTC resistor rises with rise in temperature. A thin wire of platinum \nor other metallic alloys shows linear changes with its temperature. These can be used for \nsensing temperature and measuring the values over very wide ranges of temperatures, \nsay (0\u20131600\u00b0C). \n\n3 Bit to 8 Decoder \n\nShift Clock \n\nShift Clock \n\nSerial Key \nState Data \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nEight on- \noff Keys \n\n8 Bit to 3 \n\nSerial \nShifter \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nArray \nSelect \n\nSerial \nData \n\nPair \nSelect \n\nShift \nClock \n\n10 bit \nParallel to \n\nSerial \nShifter \n\nFive Arrays \n\nof ten \n\nn-p-n \nPhoto- \nTransistor- \nLED Pairs \n\neach \n\nEight Arrays of Eight Pairs of \nPhotoconductors Laser Light \nDiode each \n\nDetector States 8 bit Parallel to \n\nSerial Shifter \nSerial Data \n\nArray \nSelect Lines \nMicrocontroller \n\n( a ) \n\n( c ) \n\n( b ) \n\nFigure 7.7 Microcontroller electronic circuits for sensing on-off states of (a) an array of 8 switches, \n\n(b) two-dimensional array of 50 sensors for 10 sales level when automatic chocolate vending \nmachine sells 5 flavours, and (c) array of 64 sensors at parking slots with a sensor for each slot \n\n244 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nExample 7.2 described the measuring principle and procedure of using a resistance \nbridge, signal conditioning amplifier and ADC for generating input to a microcontroller. \nFigure 7.1 shows the circuit. \n\nCertain ICs, such as AD590, function as temperature transducer and generate 1 m A \nfor every 1\u00b0C rise in temperature. The output of the transducer connects to a signal \nconditioning amplifier, ADC and then to the serial port interface at the microcontroller. \nThis circuit is similar to the circuit in Figure 7.1 except that in place of a resistance bridge, \nan IC transducer is used. \n\nReadily available temperature sensors have in-built circuitry with three terminals, viz. \ntwo for 5 V or 3.6 V supply + and \u2013 terminals and one for ADC input, V in . \n\nHumidity \n\nHumidity is measured in percentage. It is the relative percentage \nratio (RH%) of content of water vapours in air compared to one \nin a situation of maximum possible water vapour content for the \nair temperature at the instance of measurement. Greater than \n90% humidity signifies it is a rainy day. A capacitor sensor shows change in capacitance as \na percentage of relative humidity changes. \n\nReadily available humidity sensors show output voltage proportional to RH% \n(Humidity sensor available from Sparkfun, an US company). The sensor is given input \nsupply at + and \u2013 (ground) potential terminals and it generates output V RH as a function \nof RH%. \n\nFigure 7.2 shows a circuit for sensing using capacitive sensors, except that in place of \ncapacitance bridge output, the sensor circuit is in-built in readily available sensors. V RH is \ndirectly given to the ADC, and ADC output to the serial port interface at the microcontroller. \nThe circuit can be used for measuring RH%. The computations give RH%. \n\nDistance \n\nInfrared (IR) sensor is useful for a 0.15 m to 0.8 m range of object. \nIR sensor works on the principle that when a narrow beam IR LED \nsends radiation at an inclined angle, the nearby phototransistor \nFPT receives the reflected radiation after travelling two times the \nobject distance. The reflected radiation delay (= 2 \u00a5 3.3 ns per m) \nbetween transmitted and reflected signal is proportional to the \ndistance. The distance can be measured for object from 0.1 m to 0.8 m. Above 0.8 m, the \nreflected intensity may be insufficient for detection and below 0.15 m, the time interval is \nless than 1 ns, which inhibits the detection. \n\nReadily available distance-based (IR) sensors shows output voltage proportional to \ndistance (Sparkfun distance IR sensor). The sensor LED is given input supply at + and \u2013 \n(ground) potential terminals and IR-FPT along with internal circuitry generate output V dis \nas a function of distance. V dis is directly given as input to the ADC and ADC output to the \nmicrocontroller serial port. The computations give the distance. \n\nUse of capacitance \nchanges for measuring \n\nRH% \n\nUse of time intervals \nbetween IR pulses and \n\nreflected pulses for \nmeasuring the distance \n\nof an object \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n245 \n\nAlternatively, ultrasonic sensors send the pulses. The \nfrequencies of ultrasonic waves are of few kilocycles. The \ndetection of echo from ultrasonic pulses and an associated \ncircuitry generate a signal proportional to the distance. Ultrasonic \nwave delay is 2 \u00a5 3 millisecond/meter in air as the speed of sound \nin air is 330 m/s. Long-range distances and any obstacles nearby \ncan be detected using ultrasonic sensors. These sensors are used in industrial automation, \nrail tracks and oil pipeline faults. \n\nLight \n\nExample 7.1 shows that a photoconductor can be used to detect \nlight in the vicinity. The sensor shows a drop in resistance with \nsurrounding light. Alternatively, the p-n junction photodiode \nor phototransistor can be used to measure incoming radiation \nintensity incoming from a particular direction. Figure 7.1 \nshows that the output of the sensor circuit connects the signal \nconditioning amplifier, ADC and microcontroller. \n\nAcceleration \n\nA Micro-Electro-Mechanical Sensor (MEMS) detects linear \naccelerations a x , a y and a z along three axes x , y and z , respectively. \nAn MEMS moves when a mass moves along a direction. A \nmechanical movement has three components. The variations \ncause the variation in three capacitance values, C x , C y and C z . The \nvalue of each C depends on the space between two plane surfaces, \nwhich varies on acceleration along an axis. These capacitances \nare part of an electronic circuit and the resulting voltage variations give the a x , a y and a z . \n\nAn accelerometer sensor is used in new generation mobile phones. The display screen \nimage and menu items rotate and align horizontally or vertically on detecting the three \ncomponents using the sensor when it rotates along with the phone. The accelerometer also \ndetects up/down, right/left and front/back accelerations given to the device by the user. \n\nSparkfun ADX335 is a readily available accelerometer sensor. The accelerometer is \ngiven input supply at + and \u2013 (ground) potential terminals and it generates three outputs, \nV x , V y and V z as a function of time. The computations give a x , a y and a z . Figure 7.8 shows \nthe accelerometer circuit. \n\nVibrations and Shocks \n\nAlternatively, MEMS may use piezoelectric effect in place of \ncapacitive change effects. The effect observed in certain specific \nmaterials is accumulation of electric changes on surfaces due \n\nUse of photoconductor, \np-n junction photodiode \n\nor phototransistor for \n\nmeasuring the \nintensity of light \n\nUse of MEMS \nfor measuring \nthe acceleration \ncomponents in three \n\naxes by capacitive \nvariations in three axes \n\nMEMS measures the \nvibrations and shocks \n\nby changes due to \npiezoelectric effect \n\nUse of time intervals \n\nbetween ultrasonic \npulses and their echoes \n\nfor measuring distance \n\nfrom an object \n\n246 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nto mechanical compression of the piezoelectric material. The rate of change of number \nof charges with time implies a flow of current. Vibrations create repeated compression \nand decompression. An associated electronic circuit generates output according to the \nintensity of vibrations. The circuit also senses the mechanical shocks. A user initiates the \nvibrations or shocks, or the device shakes when it falls, then the in-built sensor in the \nmobile senses these changes and the system takes action as programmed. \n\nAngular Acceleration and Change in Direction (Angle) \n\nGyroscope is a sensor which measures the change in angular velocity (angular acceleration) \nand the change in direction (angle). An application takes measurements using a gyroscope \nor accelerometer and the system initiates actions as programmed. For example, mobile \ngaming application uses in-motion gestures of a player when deploying a gyroscope. \n\nOrientation and Direction Compass \n\nA gyroscope can be used as an electronic compass or a digital compass as it shows the \nchange in direction (angle). \n\nAlternatively a digital compass can also be used. A compass shows the directions\u2014 \nNorth, South, East and West. It also shows the direction in which an object is inclined. The \ncompass is a very simple device used for navigation. It has a magnetic strip which aligns \ntowards the Earth\u2019s magnetic north under the influence of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The \ncompass shows by how many degrees f the device\u2019s north is inclined from the actual \nEarth\u2019s magnetic north in a clockwise direction. Mobile device\u2019s north means the screen\u2019s \nupper direction, south the lower, west the left and east the right. \n\nA digital compass is an electronic device used to detect the orientation or direction \nwith respect to the north in degrees. The compass gives a digital output in terms of a \nsequence of 1s and 0s. A readily available digital compass sensor sends 1s and 0s to the \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nV + \n\nADC0 \n\nADC1 \n\nADC2 \n\nPISO0 \n\nPISO1 \n\nPISO2 \nV \u2212 \n\nComponent \nx, y or z select \n\nSerial \nClock \n\nSerial \n\nData \n\nAcceleration \n\nx, y, z \ncomponent \n\nSensor \n\nFigure 7.8 Microcontroller electronic circuit for measuring three acceleration components from the \n\naccelerometer sensor \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n247 \n\nmicrocontroller serial port. The sensor is given input supply at + (V CC ) and \u2013 (ground) \npotential terminals and it connects serial-port terminals, SCL (Serial Clock) and SDA \n(Serial Data) (Section 7.5). The sequence of serial bits corresponds to a byte (8-bit binary \nnumber). For that number computation give angle f with respect to the north direction. \n\nMagnetic Sensors/Magnetometer \n\nExample 7.7 explains sensing principle and procedure. \n\nExample 7.7 \n\nProblem \nHow does a magnetometer show the direction and changes in the magnetic field? \n\nSolution \n\nA magnetometer present in a device enables three-dimensional interactions between a tiny magnet M1 in \nthe device and a nearby iron magnetised piece M2 without touch. It uses the magnetic field created in the \nenvironment of the device. The magnetometer is also used as an orientation, proximity and distance sensor \nfor iron or steel objects in industrial automation. \n\nOne application also identifies presence of iron or steel objects and switches off the phone upon detection. \nAnother application monitors the changes in magnetic fields of M1 and identifies the gestures of the user. \n\nElectric Current \n\nAlternating Current (AC) is detected by a miniature transformer and its associated \ncircuitry. A Direct Current (DC) flows in one direction at all instances. It detects using \na sensor circuit, which detects the magnetic field by flowing current. Readily available \nelectric current i and voltage v or power (product of i and v ) are used. They can connect \nto the microcontroller using its associated circuitry. The computation can be done in the \nmicrocontroller. A wireless transmitter can transmit the data through Wi-Fi to the utility \ncompany. \n\nSound \n\nA microphone is used to sense sound. A readily available electronic board with a \nmicrophone connects to the microcontroller, which can control an actuator for actions \nbased on the sensed sound, or recognise the voice and then take required action, such as \ndialing a number using the actuator circuit or switching on the car. \n\nSensing the Things \n\nReading Barcodes \n\nA barcode is a representation of data. The data relates to the \nobject where the printed code strip is attached. The code is read \nby an optical scanner. Earlier a barcode would systematically \n\nBar coding uses 1D or \n\n2D code \n\n248 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nrepresent data by varying the widths and spacing of parallel lines. The code was a linear \nor one-dimensional code (1D). Later, barcodes evolved into rectangles, dots, hexagons \nand other geometric patterns in two dimensions (2D). The 2D system use symbols which \nare also referred to as barcodes. \n\nA barcode reader is a scanner for a printed code called the barcode. An electronic device \nreads the output for a port of microcontroller or computing device or computer. The \nscanner has a light source. When it is switched on, the light impulses pass through a lens \nand focuses on the black and white spaces of the barcode. The light source can be laser \nbased or LED based. \n\nReflected light sensor or CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector at the scanner along \nwith an associated decoder circuit converts the optical impulses into electronic pulses \nand analyses the barcode\u2019s image data. The resolution commonly used is of dimension \n0.33 mm of the printed code. The sensor sends the contents of the barcode as 1s and 0s at \nthe input port of the computing device. \n\nQR Code \n\nQR code is an abbreviation for Quick Response Code. It was first used in automotive \nindustry. Its applications are product identification, tracking, marketing and document \nmanagement. \n\nThe QR code uses standardised encoding modes, such as numeric, alphanumeric, byte/ \nbinary or other. The code stores the data efficiently and is extendable. It is now popular in \nindustries other than the automotive industry. It is read faster and the data stored is more \nthan that using a standard Universal Product Code (UPC). \n\nThe QR code consists of black square dots arranged in a square grid format on a white \nbackground. The required data is at patterns in both horizontal and vertical components \nof the image. A scanner or camera reads the code and the data is processed using an \nerror-correction method called Reed Solomon method. The processing takes place till the \nprocess results in appropriate interpretation of the data. \n\nMotion Sensors for Moving Objects \n\nMotion or speed is measured in m/s. The sensor measures delay between successive \nreflected IR light pulses. An LED source is an IR light source and a phototransistor is an IR \nsensor. Alternatively, ultrasonic wave echoes can be used to sense the motion of light. The \nsensor measures the delay between successive echoes. \n\nReadily available motion sensors, such as Sparkfun sensor show output voltage \nproportional to motion. The sensor is given input supply at + and \u2013 (ground) potential \nterminals and it generates output V m as a function of m/s. \n\nThe computations give variation in the speed of nearby objects and also show vibrations. \nSecurity systems use the motion sensors to communicate data on the Internet and raise \nsecurity alarms. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n249 \n\nPressure Sensors \n\nPressure P is measured as force per m 2 . Pressure can be sensed \nin a number of ways. The sensor is called pressure transducer, \npressure transmitter, pressure sender or pressure indicator. \nPiezometer pressure transducer uses a piezoelectric object \nbetween two surfaces. The compression creates electric charges \non the opposite surfaces of the object. The flow of charges \ngenerates current and voltages, which provide the measure of pressure. \n\nA resistive sensor also measures variation of resistance with force. The force creates \nstress and thus the strain. \n\nReadily available pressure sensors, such as Sparkfun sensor show output voltage \nproportional to pressure. The sensor is given input supply at + and \u2013 (ground) potential \nterminals and it generates output V P as a function of P . \n\nApplication of pressure sensor can be explained as, a tyre pressure monitoring system \nuses the pressure sensors on each tyre. The sensors communicate the tyre pressure in each \ntyre, and a corresponding monitoring circuit sends alerts on the dashboard of the vehicle. \n\nFigure 7.1 shows the circuit for sensing using resistance sensors, except that in place of \nresistance bridge output, the sensor circuit is in-built using readily available sensors. V P is \ndirectly given to the ADC, and ADC output to the serial port interface at the microcontroller. \nThe circuit can be used for measuring P . The computations give the pressure, P . \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Sensor \n\nEnvironment parameters are temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and light. A \ncollective use of these parameter sensors enable monitoring of the environment. The data \nof these sensors adapts to the requirement and sends communication on the Internet \nto the cloud or web for the environment monitoring applications. For example, light \nenvironment on the streets monitors the lights (Examples 1.2 and 5.5). \n\nLocation Data \n\nDetermining location of an object means finding its distance from several fixed locations \nwhich are in multiple directions and also measuring the intensity of light or IR or ultrasonic \nwaves enables computations for a location, in case the source location intensities and \nattenuation per metre is known. \n\nGPS \n\nLocation determination can be done using a Global Positioning System (GPS), also \nknown as Geographical Positioning System. A user can receive the location from a service \nprovider. The service provider finds the GPS location through signals from satellites. The \nservice provider finds the user location with respect to the service provider through its \nbase stations. \n\nPressure sensors \nuse the resistance \nchanges due to strain. \n\nAlternatively, they use \n\npiezoelectric effect \n\n250 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nCamera \n\nCamera is an image sensor. The camera uses CCD, which consists of a large number of \npixels, exposed to the light from the image. It accumulates charges on each of the pixel \npresent at a large number of horizontal and vertical coordinates. The charge accumulation \nis as per the intensity of light at the corresponding pixel coordinate in the image. Coloured \ncamera has set of R, G and B (Red, Green and Blue) light intensity components at each \npixel coordinate. \n\nThe camera generates a file from the R, G and B intensities at each image pixel. The file \ngets saved in the memory after compression in jpg or gif or any other standard format. A \ncomputer communicates the saved file to the Internet for applications such as industrial \nIoT, home security systems, ATM security systems, automotive IoT or participatory \nsensing IoT. \n\nLIDAR \n\nLIDAR (Light + Radar) [Laser Imaging, Detection and Ranging] sensors and laser 3D \nimaging technology enables remote sensing and imaging. It finds distances by throwing \nlight using laser on target. The sensor senses the reflected light which enables computations \nof distance. \n\nLaser 3D Imaging \n\n3D imaging is feasible using laser 3D imaging technology. The technology uses both \nscanning and non-scanning systems. 3D gated viewing laser radar is a non-scanning \nsystem using pulse laser and fast gated camera. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Sensors can sense temperature, humidity, acceleration, angular acceleration, object distance, \norientation angle with respect to a fixed direction, magnetic object proximity, touch and gestures of \nusers, motion, sound, vibrations, shocks, electric current and environment conditions. \n\n\u25cf Many IoT applications need data generated from sensing devices. A sensor converts physical energy \nlike heat, sound, strain, flex, pressure, vibrations and motion into electrical energy. An electronic \ncircuit is associated with sensor.

An attached motor, speaker, LED or an output device \nconverts electrical energy into physical action. Examples of \napplications of actuators are: \n\n\u25cf Light sources \n\n\u25cf LEDs \n\nDescribe \nthe uses of \nactuators in \n\ndevices \n\nLO 7.3 \n\n258 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf Piezoelectric vibrators and sounders \n\n\u25cf Speakers \n\n\u25cf Solenoids \n\n\u25cf Servomotor \n\n\u25cf Relay switch \n\n\u25cf Switching on a set of streetlights \n\n\u25cf Application of brakes in a moving vehicle \n\n\u25cf Ringing of alarm bell \n\n\u25cf Switching off or on a heater or air-conditioner or boiler current in a steam boiler in a \nthermal plant. \n\nLight Source \n\nTraffic lights are examples of function of light sources as actuators controlled by the inputs. \n\nLED \n\nLED is an actuator which emits light or infrared radiation. Uses of different colour LEDs, \nRGB (Red-Green-Blue) LEDs, intensity variation of LED and colours, graphic and text \ndisplay using big screens are actions which are controlled using the inputs. RGB LED has \nthree inputs to control, i.e. R, G and B components and thus the composite colour. Pulse \nwidth modulated pulses control the LED light emission intensity. A microcontroller is \nused for generating PWM outputs. \n\nPiezoelectric Vibrator \n\nPiezoelectric crystals when applied in varying electric voltages at the input generate \nvibrations. \n\nPiezoelectric Speaker \n\nA piezoelectric speaker enables synthesised music tunes and sounds. The appropriately \nprogrammed pulses generate the music, sounds, buzzers and alarms when they are the \ninput to the speaker. A microcontroller is used for generating PWM outputs for actions \nusing speakers. \n\nSolenoid \n\nA solenoid is an actuator consisting of a number of cylindrically wound coils. The flow of \ncurrent creates a magnetic field in proportion to the number of turns in the solenoid and \nthe current in it. If a shaft made of iron is placed along the axis, then its motion can be \ncontrolled by the input current, pulses and variations of current with time. It can create \na sharp forward push, backward push and repeated to and fro motion. It can also create \nrotator motion from linear motion by using a Cam. \n\nA cam with linear shaft assembly is used in an engine to convert rotatory motion into \nlinear motion and vice versa. A cam is an especially cut mechanical rotating object such \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n259 \n\nthat the radius linearly increases (from the centre) between 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 rotation and \ndecreases between 180\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. When a cam assembly rotates, then a linear shaft moves \nin forward and backward motions in each rotation. \n\nMotor \n\nA motor can be DC (direct current controlled) or AC (alternating current controlled). IO \nmodules are readily available to receive the control digital inputs of 1s and 0s and deliver \nhigh currents. The dc or ac rotates the motor. A cam also converts rotator motion into \nlinear motion when it rotates using a motor. \n\nServomotor \n\nServomotor is a geared DC motor for applications such as robotics. It rotates the shaft of \na motor. The shaft of the motor can be controlled and positioned or rotated through 180\u00b0 \n(+90\u00b0) degrees. The shaft\u2019s angular position is controlled through 180\u00b0, between \u201390\u00b0 and \n+90\u00b0 degrees. \n\nExample 7.12 \n\nProblem \nHow does angular position in a servomotor shaft \ncontrol using input pulse widths? \n\nSolution \n\nA servomotor has just three terminals, viz. two \nfor voltage supply + and \u2013 terminals and one for a \npulse width modulated (PWM) input. A servomotor \nis conveniently controlled by PWM. The motor has \nthree terminals. Two are for the supply voltage and \nground. A position control PWM signal to the motor \nis given at the third terminal. \n\nFigure 7.12 shows an interface circuit for \ncontrolling servomotor angular position. The pulse \nrepeats 50 times (means at 20 ms intervals) to the \nmotor input. The input is through a PWM control \noutput at a port pin of microcontroller. It controls \nthe movement as well as the angle of a servomotor \nbetween \u201390\u00b0 and +90\u00b0. \n\nThe microcontroller has an internal circuit to generate pulses of different widths as per \nvalue, p loaded in the PWM register. \n\nWhen the port output PWM pulse is of width 1.5 ms, then it places the shaft at a mid- \nangular position. Let us assume that when the pulse width is 1 ms, the angle is \u201390\u00b0. When \nthe width is 2 ms, then the angular position is +90\u00b0. Varying the width, pw ms between 1 \n\nMicrocontroller \n\nPulses of width \n\n1 ms to 2 ms \nrepeat every 20 ms \n\nPulse width \n\nmodulator \n\nPower \nTransistor \n\nServomotor \n\nGround \nPotential \n\nV + \n\nFigure 7.12 Microcontroller circuit for \n\ncontrolling servomotor angular \nposition \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p286_i0.png)\n260 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nand 2 ms using the PWM register value will change the angular position, f = [(pw \u20131.5) \u00d7 \n180\u00b0] When pw = 1.5 ms, then, f = 0\u00b0 (mid angular position), when 1 ms, then \u201390\u00b0; when \n2 ms, then +90\u00b0. \n\nRelay Switch \n\nAn electronic switch can be controlled by the input 1 or 0 from the port pin of a \nmicrocontroller or through a push button switch and battery. The current flows through \nthe switch or voltage applies through the switch depending upon the input state 1 or 0. \n\nA relay switch makes mechanical contact when the input circuit magnetises with a \ncontrol circuit and pulls a lever to make the contact. The current flows through the switch \nor voltage applies through the switch depending upon the input state 1 or 0 from the port \npin of a microcontroller or through a push-button switch and battery. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf An actuator is a device which takes actions as per the control inputs or command using 1s and 0s, \npulse or state (1 or 0) or set of 1s and 0s or width of the input pulses of 1s and 0s. \n\n\u25cf Examples of actuators are light sources, LEDs, piezoelectric vibrators and sounders, speakers, \nsolenoids servomotor, relay switch, switching on a set of streetlights, application of brakes of a \nmoving vehicle, ringing of alarm bell, and switching off or on a heater or an air-conditioner or a \nboiler current in a steam boiler in a thermal plant. \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

A \nmicrocontroller includes interfaces for serial communication. \nUART and several other protocols are popularly used. Wired \ncommunication can be: \n\n\u25cf Serial asynchronous communication, such as, using UART communication. A RFID \nreader uses a 125 kHz RFID UART module. A GPS device also sends serial data using \nthe UART. \n\nDescribe the \n\nuses of data \ncommunication using \n\nserial bus protocols \n\nLO 7.4 \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n261 \n\n\u25cf Synchronous serial-communication devices, such as sensors which can communicate \nserial data using I2C or SPI interfaces in wired bus communication. \nAutomotive sensors communicate serial data using LIN, CAN, MOST, IEEE 1394 serial \nprotocols (Section 2.3.2). \n\n7.5.1 \nSerial Bus \n\nA bus gives the following advantages 1 in sensor circuits and connecting devices: \n\n1. Simplifies number of interconnections compared to direct connections between them \n2. Provides a common way (protocol) of connecting different or same type of I/O \n\ndevices \n3. Can add a new device or system\u2019s interface that is compatible with a system\u2019s I/O bus \n4. Provides flexibility, allowing a system to support many different I/O devices \n\ndepending on the needs of its users and allowing users to change the I/O devices \nthat are attached to a system as their needs change. \nWidely used communication protocols for serial bus communication are Inter-Integrated \nCircuit (I2C), Universal Serial Bus (USB) and FireWire (is now a standard and known as \nIEEE 1394).Widely used serial bus communication protocols for serial communication in \nautomobiles\u2019 internal sensors and other embedded circuits are Local Interconnect Network \n(LIN), Controller Area Network (CAN) and Media Oriented System Transport (MOST). 2 \n\nA serial interface communicates serially with another device serial interface for: \n\n\u25cf Sending the sensor data on a network, for example in an automobile. \n\n\u25cf Receiving commands to control the actuator actions through the microcontroller serial \noutput. \nA microcontroller program prepares the interface. Preparation means configuring the \ndevice for serial interfacing. The configuration also sets the data rate at the beginning of \nthe data receive or send program. A program reads the bytes from the serial port inputs, \nand sends the outputs at serial or parallel ports. \n\nUART for Serial Bus \n\nA UART device sends 8-bit data at successive intervals, called baud intervals. A start bit \nprecedes the data (characters). Start bit means 1 becoming 0 for certain interval, called \nbaud interval before the 8-bit data. A stop bit is 1 for a minimum interval equal to baud \ninterval. The bit succeeds the 8-bits data which means 10 bauds per character. Each digit \nor command communicates 8 bits. Each character communicates 8 bit and is coded as per \nthe ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) code. \n\nSoftware Serial Library \n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) for a microcontroller system provides a \nsoftware serial library. A library consists of number of programs. A software serial library \n\n1 http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/bus.html and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication \n2 Raj Kamal, Embedded Systems- Architecture, Programming and Design 3/e, McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi, 2014, \npp.169-174. \n\n262 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nhas distinct programs for each serial interface protocol. A program enables a user to \ndirectly use a protocol. For example, a library program is used for reading an RFID tag. \nAnother can be used for sending data to a USB port. A USB port is used for onward \ntransmission to the Internet. \n\nUsing UART Communication for a RFID Tag \n\nA header character is sent before the tag. A tag ID has ten digit characters. An end \ncharacter consists of 1 byte. It succeeds the 10 digits of the tag. The total number of digits \ncommunicated is equal to 12. \n\nReciprocal of baud interval is called baud rate. The 125 kHz corresponds to 125 kbaud/s \n(kilo bauds per second) which means 12.5 k characters per second. \u2018Baud\u2019 is a German \nword that means drop, such as raindrop. Bits in UART protocol communicate like bauds. \n\nA library program for RFID using UART serial interface protocol enables its direct use \nfor an RFID tag. \n\nUsing the I2C protocol for a Serial Bus \n\nIntegrated circuits, sensors or actuators can be interconnected with the serial synchronous \ninterface, I2C. A library program for I2C serial interface protocol enables direct use of a \nsensor IC. I2C bus means different integrated circuits using I2C interface communication \nover the same set of wires. \n\nI2C is inter-integrated circuit bus. Sensors using I2C bus protocol consists of two active \nsignal terminals, i.e. Serial Data (SDA) and Serial Clock (SCL) lines and one ground line \nterminal. Uses of I2C, pronounced as I square C (I2C) are for serial bus communication \nof the number of device circuits. For example, one for flash memory, touch screen, one \nfor measuring temperature and one for measuring pressure in a number of processes \nin a plant. These ICs mutually network through a common synchronous serial bus. \nFigure 7.13 shows bus SCL and SDA lines for serial synchronous data communication \nusing I2C protocol. \n\nSCL \n\nInternet \nUSB \n\nSDA \n\nSensor with I2C \n\nInterface \n\nSensor with I2C \n\nInterface \n\nSensor with I2C \n\nInterface \n\nI2CBus \n\nIC with I2C \n\nInterface \n\nMicrocontroller with I2C \n\nand USB Interface and \nSoftware Serial Library \n\nPrograms for I2C and \n\nUSB \n\nFigure 7.13 \nBus SCL and SDA lines for serial synchronous data communication using I2C protocol \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n263 \n\nThree I2C bus standards are industrial 100 kbps I2C, 100 kbps SM I2C and 400 kbps I2C. \nI2C is serial computer bus which communicates single ended (one-end communicating \nat an instance), multi-master (number of master devices can connect the bus) and multi- \nslave (number of slave devices can connect the bus). A communicating device sends \nsignals using SCL and SDA and can function as a master. Another device receiving signals \nSCL and SDA is the slave. The receiving device acknowledges use input SCL of master for \nsending SDA output. \n\nUsing the LIN Serial Bus \n\nLocal Interconnect Network (LIN) is a serial bus network protocol for communication \nbetween automobile circuits, sensors and actuator circuits, components and systems, \nsuch as window movements, seat movements and wipers. The protocol is simpler to use \ncompared to CAN in automobiles. \n\nLIN communication is single master with maximum 15 slaves with no bus arbitration. \nNo bus arbitration means the bus does not select the destination, when number of devices \nrequest for the bus. 3 \n\nLIN features are (i) use of single wire using which communication up to 19.2 kbit/s for \n40 m bus length can be done, (ii) variable length of data frame (2, 4 and 8 byte) and (iii) \nconfiguration flexibility. \n\nUsing the CAN Protocol for Serial Bus \n\nEmbedded controllers with sensors and actuators are networked and are controlled \nthrough the CAN bus. Figure 7.14 shows serial bidirectional line network of number of \nCAN controllers and devices. \n\nCAN_L \n\nInternet \nUSB \n\nV+ \n\nGround \n\nSensor with CAN \n\nInterface \n\nSensor with CAN \n\nInterface \n\nSensor with CAN \n\nInterface \n\nCAN Bus \n\nController with CAN \n\nInterface \n\nMicrocontroller with \nCAN and USB Interface \n\nand Software Serial \nLibrary Programs for \n\nCAN and USB \n\nCAN_H \n\nFigure 7.14 CAN bus serial bidirectional line network of number of CAN controllers and devices on a \n\nCAN bus \n\n3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Interconnect_Network \n\n264 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA library program for CAN serial interface protocol enables direct use for embedded \ncircuits with a sensor. CAN bus means different controller circuits using CAN communicate \nwith the same set of wires. \n\nA number of devices are located and are distributed in a Vehicular Control Network \n(VCN). An automobile uses a number of distributed controllers. The controllers provide \nthe controls for brakes, engine, electric power, lamps, temperature, air conditioning, car- \ngate, front display panel, meter display panels and cruising. Medical electronics and \nindustrial-plant serial communication also use the CAN bus. \n\nCAN bus has a serial bidirectional line. A CAN device receives or sends a bit at an \ninstance by operating at the maximum rate of 1 Mbps. It employs a twisted pair connection \nto each node. The pair runs up to a maximum length of 40 m. A CAN version also functions \nup to 2 Mbps. CAN bus is a standard bus in a distributed network. \n\nUsing USB Bus \n\nUniversal Serial Bus (USB) is a bus between a host system and a number of interconnected \nperipheral devices. Maximum 127 devices can connect to a host. It provides a fast (up to \n12 Mbps) and as well as a low-speed (up to 1.5 Mbps) serial transmission and reception \nbetween the host and serial devices. Both the host and devices can function in a system. \nThree standard protocols for USB are USB 1.1 (a low speed 1.5 Mbps 3 meter channel \nalong with a high speed 12 Mbps 25 meter channel), USB 2.0 (high speed 480 Mbps 25 \nmeter channel), and wireless USB (high speed 480 Mbps 3 m). \n\nA library program for USB serial interface protocol enables direct use for USB bus \nconnected host system and serial devices. \n\nUSB bus uses tree topology. A host connects to the devices or nodes using a USB port \ndriving software and a host controller. The host computer or system has a host-controller, \nwhich connects to a root hub. A hub is one that connects to other nodes or hubs. A tree-like \ntopology forms in which the root hub connects to the hub and node at level 1 and a hub at \nlevel 1 connects to the hub and node at level 2 and so on. \n\nUsing the IEEE 1394 Bus Standard (FireWire) Protocol \n\nDigital video cameras, digital camcorders, Digital Video Disk (DVD), set-top boxes, high- \ndefinition audio-video and music systems multimedia peripherals, latest hard disk drives, \nand printers need a high-speed bus standard interface directly to a personal computer. \nIEEE 1394 is a standard for 800 Mbps serial isosynchronous data transfer. Isosynchronous \nmeans that bits in data frame communicate synchronously, but frames in-between time \ninterval can be variable. \n\nUsing the MOST Protocol \n\nThe communication functionality is provided by a driver software called MOST network \nservices. The services are service programs. The software for processing the MOST protocol \ncommunication between a MOST Network Interface Controller (NIC) and devices. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n265 \n\nThe services enable a user to directly use these service programs, such as communicating \nmedia files using MOST NIC. \n\nMOST protocol enables high-speed serial bus for synchronous data communication. It \nforms a multimedia network optimised for automotive and other industries. The MOST \nbus uses a ring topology. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Each serial interface uses a serial communication protocol.

RFID is an identification system using tagging \nand labelling of objects. The following subsections give a detailed description of RFID \ntechnology. \n\n7.6.1 \nRFID IoT Systems \n\nSection 2.3.1 described the RFID wireless communication. A tag enables identification of \nan object at different locations and times. A product, parcel, postal article, person, bird, \nanimal, vehicle or object can have a tag or label in order to make the identification feasible. \n\nThe reader circuit of an ID can use UART or NFC protocol to identify the tag, when the \nRFID tag is at a distance less than 20 cm. An active NFC device/mobile generates an RF \nfield which induces the currents in RFID and generates enough power for RFID. Using \nthat power, the RFID transmits the identification of tag contents. \n\nPassive device drives power from the electrical current induced in its antenna by the \nincoming RF signals from a reader or hotspot, and then transmits the tag information back. \nThe active device has an in-built power source (battery) and transmits the information on \nits own. \n\nA hotspot consists of a wireless transceiver or Wi-Fi transceiver for Internet connectivity. \nIt receives signals from a number of RFID tags in an organisation and transmits the data \nto the web server over the Internet. The hotspot connects to the Internet for IoT services, \napplications and business processes. A mobile or wireless nearby the device can also \nfunction as a hotspot. \n\nRFIDs form an IoT network. They connect to the Internet and then to an IoT server. \nAn IoT server consists of RFID identity manager, device manager, data router, analyser, \nstorage and database server and services. \n\nPrinciple of RFID \n\nA tag is an electronic circuit which transmits its ID using RF \nsignals. The ID transmits to a reader, then that transmits along \nwith the additional information to a remote server or cloud \nconnected through the Internet. The additional information is as \nper the application. For example, for a tracking application, it is \nlocation and time-stamped data along with the ID. Example 7.13 gives the methods for \ncommunication of an ID from a tag and its reading by a reader. \n\nExplain the \nRadio Frequency \nIdentification (RFID) \n\ntechnology \n\nLO 7.5 \n\nRFID device functions \nas a tag or label which \nmay be placed over an \n\nobject \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n267 \n\nExample 7.13 \n\nProblem \nHow does an RFID tag communicate and is read by a reader? \n\nSolution \n\n\u25cf Method 1: Communication is according to UART protocol of 10-bit per character. Reading RFID tag for \nprocessing is as follows\u2014the tag circuit communicates first a header, which corresponds to ASCII code \nfor a carriage return. The code is 13 d . Then ten digits (bytes) communicate which correspond to unique \ntag ID. The end byte is for communicating the finishing of data. The byte corresponds to new line ASCII \ncode. The code is 10 d . Twelve bytes communicate serially. \n\n\u25cf Method 2: Communication is according to NFC or another protocol, for which the ID reader is adapted. \n\nAn RFID tag has an advantage over a barcode or QR code in terms of simpler processing \nof the RFID data. It can also be made invisible to a person. This is because it uses short- \nrange RF transceivers instead of light or laser. The tag transmits back a short string of \ndata to reader. The RFID reader picks the RF and communicates to the Internet or remote \nweb server or cloud server. An active system can transmit to the reader at longer range \ncompared to a passive system. An active system can receive commands, process and then \nsend information compared to no actions except sending the ID in the passive system. \n\nRFID IoT Network Architecture \n\nExample 2.2 explained a four layered ITU-T reference model for the Internet of RFIDs, \nindividual capabilities of the layers and data interchange. Fourth layer capabilities  are for \nIoT/M2M services and applications. RFID technology has many applications. \n\nRFID IoT Applications \n\nExamples are tracking and inventory control of goods, supply chain systems, business \nprocesses such as for payment, leasing, insurance, and quality management, access to \nbuildings and road tolls or secured store centre entries, and devices such as RFID based \ntemperature or any other parameter sensor. New applications of RFID network have been \nfound in designing a factory, protecting a brand and anti-counterfeiting measures. \n\nComponents of an RFID System \n\nFigure 7.15 shows the components needed in a system for IoT applications and services. \n\nThe components of an RFID system are: \nRFID is a tiny chip which functions as a tag or label onto an \nobject. The chip is one of three types\u2014passive, active and battery- \npowered passive (battery switches when reader is nearby). \n\nA transceiver is in-built at the chip. It communicates in a range \n10 cm to 200 m according to the chip. The chip does UART \ncommunication to the reader either using RF link or does NFC \n\nComponents of an \n\nRFID system are \nthe tag, transceiver, \nreader, data processing \nsubsystem, middleware, \n\nand applications and \n\nservices \n\n268 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\ncommunication to the reader within 20 cm range; standard frequency range used can \nbe between 120 kHz to 150 kHz, 13.56 MHz, 433 MHz, higher when using UHF and \nmicrowave frequencies. Transceiver using RF frequencies recommended by Regulator has \nthe data transfer rate of 115 kbps using carrier RF signals from 915 MHz to 868 MHz, 315 \nMHz or 27 MHz. \n\nA nearby RFID reader for receiving ID uses the transceiver within it. It receives the \nheader which consists of 1 start byte, then 10 byte ID and then one end byte when using \nthe UART protocol. Hotspot, mobile or computer with wireless transceiver or Wi-Fi \ntransceiver transmits and receives signals from the RFID tag. \n\nData processing subsystem : A reader associates a data processing subsystem which \nconsists of a computing device and a middleware and provides connectivity to the \nInternet, directly or through a gateway which includes a data adaptation sublayer. The \nsubsystem is a backend system. A reader circuit may send data directly or through a \ncomputer, mobile or tablet to the Internet. The computations for transmission (of the \ncontents information of tagged device) are usually little. Example of a reader is SparkFun \nSEN-08419 for prototype developments. \n\nMiddleware : Middleware are software components used at the reader, read manager, \ndata store for the transaction data store and APIs of the applications. \n\nInternet \n\nReader \n\nRFID \n\nAPIs \n\nRFID \n\nReader \n\nMiddleware \n\nTxRx \n\nTxRx \n\nComputing \n\nDevice \n\nHotspot \n\nTxRx \n\nTxRx \n\nDatacenter/ \n\nCloud/ \nWeb Server \n\nData \nStore \n\nIoT Applications \n\nand Services \n\nFigure 7.15 \nComponents needed in a system for RFID IoT applications and services \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n269 \n\nApplications and services and other associated applications software use the data store at \nthe cloud or web server. \n\nIssues \n\nThe issues are: \n\n\u25cf Design issue: Designing a unique ID system needs a standard global framework. \n\n\u25cf Security issue: A tag is read only. It can thus interact with any reader and thus allows \nautomated external monitoring. A tag can thus be tracked without authority. A privacy \nissue arises when a tag and reader need not to be authenticated before their use. Full \nimplementation of privacy and security needs data processing at the tag and reader \nwith access encryption and authentication algorithms. Another issue is that the RFID \nsystem can be vulnerable to external virus attacks. \n\n\u25cf Cost issue: RFID tag and reader become costly with data processing and security \nenhancing technology. \n\n\u25cf Protection issue: The tag needs protection from the adverse weather condition which \nmay damage the tag. \n\n\u25cf Recycling issue: Recycling of the tags can be an environmental concern. \n\n\u25cf Active life issue: Active RFID, which consists of battery, has limited life of up to 2 to \n4 years. \n\n7.6.2 EPCglobal Architecture Framework \n\nMIT Auto-ID Labs is a group which consists of research \nlaboratories of seven universities. The group has designed an \narchitectural framework for IoTs. The group works in the field \nof networked RFIDs and emerging sensing technologies. The \ngroup works together with EPCglobal research group. \n\nThe group has suggested the Electronic Product Code (EPC) \nstandards, roles and architecture. The goal of the EPCglobal \narchitecture framework is assignment of a unique identity. The framework facilitates \nbusiness processes, applications and services uniquely identifying physical objects, loads, \nlocations, assets and other entities. \n\nEPCIS and ONS, Design Issues \n\nEPC Information Services (EPCIS) is a design of EPC global standards which enables EPC- \nrelated data sharing within and across enterprises. \n\nThe EPC global architecture defines the following: \n\n\u25cf EPCIS Capturing Application (ECA) for capturing EPC-related data required for \nbusiness processes \n\n\u25cf EPCIS Accessing Application (EAA) for enterprise business processes supported by \ndata captured using ECA \n\n\u25cf EPCIS-enabled Repository for storing records of events and for retrieving information \nusing queries from EAA \n\nEPCglobal is a \nstandard architecture \n\nframework, which \nuniquely identifies \nphysical objects, loads, \n\nlocations, assets and \n\nother entities \n\n270 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf Partner applications such as postal tracking system connected with payment systems. \nObject Name Service (ONS) version 2.0.1 is a standard \nrecommended in 2013. The ONS performs the lookup functions \nwhich are based upon the DNS. A DNS name enables connectivity \nto the web server using the Internet. ONS implements that \nfunction using a distributed set of servers. DNS is Domain Name \nSystem governed by IETF. Lookup function refers to looking at \nthe DNS name for enabling the web server connectivity. \n\nONS characteristics are robustness, less needs of power and memory at the tag \ncircuit and less wireless bandwidth need for the data communication. Functions of data \ncommunication use a backend network, such as a hot-spot or Wi-Fi device. Transfer of the \ndata communication task to the backend network saves the wireless bandwidth. \n\nDesign issues include governance model and architecture of the ONS. The concerns \ninvolved are: \n\n\u25cf Political for control over information \n\n\u25cf Capability issue of loss of domestic and strategic capability \n\n\u25cf Security issue of collecting business intelligence \n\n\u25cf Commercial issues \n\n\u25cf Innovation control issues \nThis joint control by countries of ONS model can handle and mitigate the risks which \nassociate the single-country control. \n\nTechnological Challenges \n\nRFID technology challenges are as follows: \n\n\u25cf Interference: When an organisation uses a number of wireless systems, since RFID \nhotspot also requires wireless installation, the frequencies may interfere among the \nsystems. The systems require effective mitigation from interference. \n\n\u25cf Effective implementation at data processing subsystem consisting of reader and tag \nprotocols, middleware architecture and EPC standards \n\n\u25cf Need of low cost tags and RFID technology \n\n\u25cf Design robustness \n\n\u25cf Data security \n\nSecurity Challenges \n\nThe issues associated with RFID security are: \n\n\u25cf Discovery of foreign attacks (intrusions) and maintain overall data integrity \n\n\u25cf Unauthorised disabling of a tag by a reader which is external, thus making the tag \nuseless \n\n\u25cf Unauthorised tag manipulation by a reader which is external, thus making the tag \nuseless \n\n\u25cf Cloning of the tag by an unauthorised entity \n\nONS enables web \nconnectivity to web \n\nserver by lookup \nfunctions based on the \n\nDNS \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n271 \n\n\u25cf Eavesdropping, which means setting up an additional reader pretending to be a reader \nbelonging to the system \n\n\u25cf Man-in-the-Middle attack: When an external object pretends to be either a tag or \nreader between system tags and readers \nSolutions can be encryption, tag deactivation on detection of intrusion, mutual \nauthentication between the tag and reader, detection of the tag owner, use of read data \nanalyser and data cleaning. Example 7.14 gives the methods for solving security issues. \n\nExample 7.14 \n\nProblem \nHow does an RFID tag securely communicate and read by a reader? How is an RFID tag secured? \n\nSolution \n\nMethod 1: An RFID tag may have a processor and memory. Then it computes one-way hash function called \nmeta ID on tag. When the RFID reader uses the meta-ID, then only the tag communication unlocks and \nthe tag becomes readable. After the reader finishes reading, the tag gets locked. This disables reading by \nunknown entities to the system. \n\nMethod 2: The tag can self-destruct if under attack. \n\nIP for an RFID in Internet of RFIDs \n\nData from the RFID reader after filtering, aggregation and routing get stored at an IP \naddress. This data is in XML format. Data accesses using HTTP and SOAP protocols. \n\nInternet protocol (IP), IPv6 is 128-bit IP address, which is required for routing data on \nthe Internet. It needs to be mapped with the 96-bit EPC. The EPC is header, manufacturer, \nproduct and serial number bits. \n\nA method for secure IPv6 communication is the use of Cryptographically Generated \nAddresses (CGAs). A host suffix/interface identifier generates a cryptographic one-way \nhash function. The function input is a public key as binary input. CGA is meant to be \nglobally unique in a statistical sense. CGAs may, however, not be workable routing \naddresses at the IP layer for RFID IoT system. \n\nAnother method is Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID). It is \na newly suggested class of identifiers. The identifier is based on CGAs. The ORCHID \nformat is compatible to IPv6-like address format. \n\nThe ORCHID identifier is used just by the APIs and applications. It differs for IPv6 \naddress. It does not identify the network locations, while IPv6 has locator which is 64-bit \nnetwork prefix. \n\n7.6.3 \nWeb of Things of RFIDs \n\nWeb of Things (WoT) means making objects a part of the World Wide Web. WoT software, \narchitecture styles such as JSON, REST, JSON, and programming patterns such as web \nsockets, makes this feasible. WoT data store of objects is similar to web pages store. The \n\n272 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nweb (application layer) receives and sends data using the Internet (IP network layer). WoT \nenables IoT applications for the RFIDs also as RFID enables identification of each object \ndistinctly on the web. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf A tag is an electronic circuit which transmits its ID using RF signals. The ID transmits to a reader \nwhich associates a computing device and connects to the Internet. \n\n\u25cf RFID forms the IoT network using the computing system which connects to the Internet and then \nto IoT server. \n\n\u25cf RFID system components for IoT applications and services are RFID tag with transceiver; reader \nwith associated computing device and transceiver; hotspot or mobile of computer for Internet \nconnectivity; middleware, and applications and services. \n\n\u25cf Middleware consists of RFID identity manager, device manager, data router, analyser, storage and \ndatabase server and services. \n\n\u25cf Examples of IoT applications of RFIDs are for tracking and inventory control, identification in supply \nchain systems, business processes, RFID based temperatures or any other parameter sensor, in \nfactory design, brand protection, and anti-counterfeiting and business processes. \n\n\u25cf Design, security, cost, protection, recycling and active life are issues in IoT RFID applications and \nservices. \n\n\u25cf EPCglobal architecture framework assigns a unique identity for business processes. Applications \nand services uniquely identify physical objects, loads, locations, assets and other entities using the \nframework. \n\n\u25cf EPC Information Services (EPCIS) is a design of EPCglobal standards which enables EPC-related data \nsharing within and across enterprises. \n\n\u25cf ONS performs the lookup functions based upon the DNS. DNS name enables web server Internet \nconnectivity using HTTP, REST, webSockets and Internet protocols. \n\n\u25cf Technological challenges are wireless interference, implementing data processing subsystems, \nreducing system components\u2019 costs, robust system design and security of the system components. \n\n\u25cf Data security solutions can be encryption, tag deactivation on intrusion detection, mutual \nauthentication between the tag and reader, detections of the tag owner, reader analyser and data \ncleaning. \n\n\u25cf RFID IoT system 128-bit IPv6 address can be generated using CGA. \n\n\u25cf ORCHID is a newly suggested class of identifiers with a format compatible to IPv6-like address \nformat. \n\n\u25cf Web of Things means making objects data and object applications and services a part of the World \nWide Web. \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

They cooperatively monitor the physical and \nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion, or \nhazardous gas-leaks and pollutants at different locations. A WSN acquires data from \nmultiple and remote locations. For example, in Internet of Waste Containers, the sensors \nwirelessly communicate the waste containers statuses in a waste management system in a \nsmart city; sensors in Internet of Streetlights acquire data of ambient light conditions; and \na WSN communicates the nearby traffic densities data for the control and monitoring of \ntraffic signals. \n\nEach node of the WSN has an RF transceiver. The transceiver functions as both, a \ntransmitter and receiver. \n\nFollowing subsections define WSN and describe its history, context, and architecture, and \nnodes, connecting the nodes, networking of the nodes and securing the communication. \nThe subsections also describe establishment of a WSN infrastructure, data-link layer MAC \nprotocols, routing protocols, various integration approaches, challenges of security, QoS \nand configuration, and WSN specific IoT applications. \n\n7.7.1 \nWSN Concepts \n\nDefinition \n\nWSN is defined as a network in which each sensor node connects wirelessly and has \nthe capability of computation, for data compaction, aggregation and analysis. Each one \nalso has communication as well as networking capabilities. A WSN consists of spatially \ndistributed autonomous devices (sensors). \n\nExplain the \nWireless Sensor \n\nNetwork (WSN) \n\ntechnology \n\nLO 7.6 \n\n274 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nWSN History \n\nSound-waves-based surveillance and tracking systems for enemy submarines were used \nin the 1950s. Wireless-based networked radars were also used during this time. Research \non the Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN) using network communication started before \n1980. The DSNs are in use since then. Many spatially distributed sensing nodes collaborate \nand network autonomously on best effort basis. Research and applications of Low Power \nWireless Integrated Micro-Sensors (LWIM) use in DSNs is ongoing since 1998. \n\nWSNs have a large number of IoT applications. Examples are smart homes and smart \ncity. The WSN nodes can sense and communicate, using the Internet, wirelessly the data \nfrom remote locations, such as industrial plant machines, forests, lakes, gas or oil pipelines, \nwhich may sometimes not be easily accessible. \n\nContext-based Node Operations \n\nThe dictionary meaning of the word \u2018context\u2019 is \u2018the circumstances that form the setting \nof an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood. A WSN \nnode can adapt, re-program or do another task using a sensor and associated circuit, \ncomputations, networking capabilities and context at that node. \n\nWhen nodes can adapt their operations in response to changes in the environment, then \nit is called context-dependent sensing, networking and computing. The application layer \nprograms help the node to differentiate the tasks to be undertaken on a changed context. \n\nThe selection of data, memory, power and routing path management, the routing \nprotocol, users, devices and application interfaces in the WSN system can be programmed \nto function as per the context, and consider the circumstances during networking and \ncomputations. \n\nContext can be a physical, computing, user, structural or temporal context. Following \nmay correspond to the context for re-programming of the actions of the WSN nodes: \n\n\u25cf Past and present surrounding situations \n\n\u25cf Actions such as the present network \n\n\u25cf Surrounding devices or systems \n\n\u25cf Changes in the state of the connecting network \n\n\u25cf Physical parameters such as present time of the day \n\n\u25cf Nearest connectivity currently available \n\n\u25cf Past sequence of actions of the device user \n\n\u25cf Past sequence of application or applications \n\n\u25cf Previously cached data records \n\n\u25cf Remaining memory and battery power at present \nA WSN reprogramming can be Over-The-Air (OTA), which means wirelessly modifying \nthe codes in flash memory through an access point by the gateway,  application or service. \n\nExample 7.15 shows how nodes, coordinators and routers take into account and adapt \ntheir tasks according to a context. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n275 \n\nExample 7.15 \n\nProblem \nHow is the context taken into account by the WSN nodes, network coordinators and routers? \n\nSolution \n\nAssume a set of WSN nodes sensing the environment conditions, which includes the detection of hazardous \ngoods or gases in an industry. As soon as a sensor senses a hazardous good, the node discovers the paths \nand protocols available for broadcasting the newly sensed information. The nodes coordinate with each \nother to send the information towards the destination. \nAssume a WSN in a forest tied with a bird or mule or another object. The node can follow any direction \nand reach any location at different instances. When the node finds another node in the WSN, it shares the \ninformation. When any node of a WSN senses and discovers wireless radiation from an access point, it off- \nloads the collected data. The access point sends that on the Internet or to another coordinating WSN with \nanother set of node. Further, the node battery can also accumulate the charge from the radiations of the \naccess point. \n\nAssume a wireless sensor node may extend the interval for temperature or other data transmission when it \nsenses low memory or power availability. When the node completes the off-loading of the data and recharges \nat the access point or coordinating node of WSN clusters, it may reduce the interval for temperature \nmeasurements. \n\n7.7.2 \nWSN Architecture \n\nWSN Node Architecture \n\nFigure 7.16 shows the three-layer architecture of a node. The three layers are application \nlayer, network layer (serial link with data-link MAC), physical cum data-link layer (MAC \n+ Physical Layer). \n\nPackets \n\nNetwork Layer \n\nSensor \n\nTransceiver Wireless Network \n\nWireless \nRadio \nCircuit + \nAntenna \n\nSensor \nNode CPU \n+ Program \n\nData Adaptation \nPhysical cum Data-link Layer \n\nApplication Layer \n\nCommunication \nSubsystem \n\nMAC + \nPhysical \n\nFigure 7.16 \nArchitecture of a wireless sensor node \n\nThe application layer software components are sensor management, sensor query \nand data dissemination, task assignment, data advertisement and application-specific \nprotocols. \n\n276 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSensor, CPU and program sensor node constitute the application and network layers. \nNetwork layer links serially to the data-link layer, and may include the coordination or \nrouting software. A serial link interconnects the layers to a wireless radio circuit and \nantenna. The radio circuit is at physical cum data-link layer. Communication subsystem \nuses MAC and physical protocols. \n\nArchitecture for Connecting Nodes \n\nFigure 7.17 shows two architectures for connecting WSN nodes, fixed connecting \ninfrastructure of WSN nodes, coordinators, relays, gateways and routers, and mobile ad- \nhoc network of WSNs, access points, routers, gateways and multi-point relays. \n\nAn access point is a fixed point transceiver to provide the accessibility to nodes present \nnearby or nodes reaching in the wireless range. A multipoint relay connects to other \nnetworks such as the Internet or mobile service provider network. A router\u2019s role is to \nselect a path for packet transmission among the presently available paths in the network. \nA coordinator provides the link between the two networks. \n\nWSN1 \n\nInternet \n\nWSN2 \nWSN3 \nWSN4 \n\nRouter or \nGateway \n\nWSN1 \n\nAccess Point \nRouter or \nGateway \n\nWSN4 \n\nWSN3 \n\nWSN2 \nInternet \n\nCoordinating WSN Node \n\nMulti-Point Relay \n\nMulti-Point Relay \n\n(ii) Ad-hoc network of mobile WSNs \n\n(i) Fixed Connecting Infrastructure \n\nFigure 7.17 Architecture for connecting WSN nodes: (i) Fixed connecting infrastructure of WSN nodes, \n\ncoordinators, relays, gateways and routers and (ii) Mobile ad-hoc network of moving WSNs \n\nFixed infrastructure example is a smart home network consisting of WSNs at security \nsurveillance points, refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave, TV and computers with Wi- \nFi access point. Another example is WSN nodes, access points, routers, gateways and \nmulti-point relays. At an industrial plant, multiple machine locations, stores, offices, sales \nand receipts and other plant locations. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n277 \n\nAd-hoc infrastructure example is mobile WSNs tied with birds or animals for habitat \nmonitoring. \n\nArchitecture for Networking of the Nodes \n\nTwo basic architectures for networking of the nodes are layered architecture and multi- \ncluster architecture. \n\nWireless Multi-Hop Infrastructure Network Architecture (MINA) \n\nMINA is a layered architecture. The WSN nodes have data sensing as well as capabilities \nof forwarding towards the access point (base station). The nodes can be mobile and have \ncoverage and mobility range for communication to remote access points. \n\nAccess points possess data gathering and processing capabilities and have connectivity \nwith a larger network, such as the Internet. Figure 7.18 shows layered architecture. \n\nEach node connects to a short-distant neighbour. When the node moves to longer \ndistances then it communicates through 2 or 3 hops to the access point (base station). Each \nnode has low-power transceivers to the nearest neighbouring layer WSNs. \n\nWSN5 \n\nInternet \n\nWSN2 \n\nWSN1 \n\nWSN3 \n\nRouter or \nGateway \n\nWSN6 \n\nLayer 2 (Two Hop \n\nWSNs) \n\nLayer 3 (Three Hops WSN) \n\nLayer 3 (Three Hops \n\nWSN) \n\nWSN4 \n\nLayer 1 (One Hop \n\nWSN 1) \n\nLayer 1 (One Hop \n\nWSN 6) \n\nAccess Point \n(Base Station) \n\nFigure 7.18 \nLayered Architecture for network of nodes \n\nAssume that the base station is surrounded by three layers of WSNs. Layer 1 WSNs \ndirectly connect. Layer 2 WSNs first connect to layer 1 WSNs functioning as coordinators \nand then directly connect. Layer 3 WSNs first connect to layer 2 WSNs functioning as \ncoordinators, then connect to layer 1 WSNs and then connect to the access point. \n\nThe figure shows that layer 1 WSN1 and WSN6 connect directly to the access point. It \nmeans hop count = 1. The figure also shows WSN 2 and WSN 3 at layer 2. They connect \nby one hop to WSN1 and next hop through WSN1. Hop count = 2 for layer 2. It means \nthat WSN 2 connects to W S N1 which has connectivity with the access point (base station). \n\n278 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nThe figure also shows WSN 4 and WSN 5 at layer 3. They connect by three hops, one to \nlayer 2 WSN and then layer 1 WSN and then to the access point. Hop count = 3 for layer \n3. It means that WSN 5 connects to WSN2, then to WSN1 and then the access point (base \nstation). WSN 4 connects to WSN3, then to WSN1 and then the access point (base station). \nAccess points connect the clusters using wireless LAN (802.11b) protocol. The access \npoints enable connectivity to the Internet. Sensor data is archived and can be queried in \nreal-time, and users with mobile devices and remote clients can access the data. \n\nMultiple Clusters Architecture \n\nEach cluster has a gateway node. A set of clusters with a gateway each has one cluster \nwith a cluster-head gateway. Multi-cluster architecture has a number of clusters, which \nassociate a cluster-head gateway. \n\nCluster-head enables a tree-like topology of the clusters in a multi-cluster architecture. \nThe cluster formation and election of cluster-heads is autonomous in distributed WSNs \nand WSN clusters. Figure 7.19 shows a multi-cluster architecture. The figure shows two \nclusters. The figure also shows a cluster-head gateway. Head gateway connects to the \nInternet or cellular of other networks and provides connectivity to WSNs in the multiple \nclusters. \n\nWSN8 \n\nGateway \n\nInternet \n\nWSN7 \n\nWSN5 \n\nWSN6 \n\nWSN9 \n\nWSN10 \n\nGateway \n\nWSN2 \n\nWSN1 \n\nWSN3 \n\nWSN4 \n\nCluster Head \nGateway \n\nCluster 2 \n\nCluster 1 \n\nFigure 7.19 \nMulti-cluster architecture for network of nodes \n\nA number of clusters associated with the cluster-head gateway depends on the coverage \nrequired in the network. When a cluster-head exists then a gateway interconnects two \nclusters. Each node connects to a short-distant neighbour. The node connects to a gateway \nnode through one, two or more hops when it connects to the WSN of another cluster. \nWhen a node moves to longer distances then it communicates to the neighbouring cluster \nthrough the gateway. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n279 \n\nCluster 1 is an ad-hoc network of mobile WSNs (WSN 1 to WSN5). The WSNs in a cluster \nmay have mesh architecture or layered architecture. Each WSN connects to another WSN \nin its wireless range. Cluster 2 is an ad-hoc network of mobile WSNs (WSN 6 to WSN10). \n\nClustered architecture enables data compaction or fusion and aggregation. A gateway \ncommunicates compacted or aggregated data to another cluster. A cluster-head further \naggregates, compacts or fuses the data before communication to the web server or cloud \nusing the Internet. \n\n7.7.3 \nWSN Protocols \n\nNetwork protocols have design goals as: (i) limit computational needs, (ii) limit use of \nbattery power and thus bandwidth limits, operation in self-configured ad-hoc setup mode \nand (iv) limit memory requirement of the protocol. \n\nThe physical layer does adaptive RF power control at the transceiver; reduces power in \ncase of nearby node, increases the power when the nearest node is at a greater distance, \nuses CMOS low power ASIC circuits and energy-efficient codes. \n\nData-link Layer Media Access Control (MAC) Protocol \n\nS-MAC (Sensor-MAC) protocol can be deployed at the data-link layer. S-MAC nodes go to \nsleep for prolong periods. They need to synchronise at periodic intervals. \n\nS-MAC protocol enables use of the energy-efficient, collision-free transmission, and \nintermittently synchronises the operations. Collision-free transmission results from \nscheduling of a channel. Each node can be allocated the channel. Channels are reused \nsuch that collision-free transmission takes place and retransmission is not resorted to. \n\nRouting Protocols \n\nThe network layer uses multi-hop route determination, energy-efficient routing, route \ncaching and directed diffusion of data. \n\nRouting protocols are either proactive or reactive. Proactive protocols keep route cache \nand determine the route in advance. Reactive protocols determine the route on demand. \nRouting protocols are table-driven when a routing table guides the paths available. \nRouting protocols are demand-driven when a source demands the route and it guides the \npaths available. \n\nFixed Wireless Sensor Networks may use Cluster-head Gateway Switch Routing \n(CGSR) which guides the paths using heuristic routing schemes. \n\n7.7.4 \nWSN Infrastructure Establishment \n\nWhen a WSN infrastructure establishes the following steps which need consideration: \n\n\u25cf Sensors with associated CMOS low power ASIC circuits, their radio ranges and \nenergy-efficient coding \n\n280 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf Infrastructure selection, (i) fixed connecting infrastructure of nodes, coordinators, \nrelays, gateways and routers, or (ii) mobile ad-hoc network of mobile WSNs with \nlimited or unspecified mobility region \n\n\u25cf Network topology and architecture according to the applications and services, wireless \nmulti-hop infrastructure network architecture or multi-cluster architecture \n\n\u25cf Network nodes self-discovering, self-configuring and self-healing protocols, \nlocalisation, mobility range, security, data-link and routing protocols, link quality \nindicator (LQI) (packet reception ratio), coverage range, and QoS required according \nto applications and services \n\n\u25cf Clusters, cluster gateways, cluster-heads and clusters hierarchy \n\n\u25cf Routing, data aggregation, compaction, fusion and direct diffusion \n\n\u25cf Synchronisation of times at intermittent intervals as time is used as reference in inter- \nnode distance estimation, accounting for the delays, localisation, ranging and location \nservices. \n\nWSN Various Integration Approaches \n\nWSN needs integrated approaches for: \n\n\u25cf Nodes design and provisioning of resources \n\n\u25cf Nodes localisation \n\n\u25cf Nodes mobility \n\n\u25cf Sensor connecting architecture \n\n\u25cf Sensor networking architectures \n\n\u25cf Data dissemination protocols \n\n\u25cf Security protocols \n\n\u25cf Data-link layer and routing protocols \n\n\u25cf Integration with sensors data, other than wireless sensors data, for IoT applications \nand services \n\nQuality of Service \n\nQuality of Service (QoS) is an average weighted QoS metric over the lifetime of a network. \nSeveral metrices are as follows: (i) Average delay: Measure of the time taken in generation \nof sensor data and its delivery up to the destination, (2) Lifetime: Time up to which the WSN \nfunctions effectively or given energy resources of the modes will last, (iii) Throughput: \nBytes per second delivered up to the destination. Low throughput means high delays. It \nalso relates to the bandwidth of the network, and (iv) Link Quality Indicator (LQI) which \nmeans packets delivered/packet transmitted from the nodes. \n\nReal-time applications of communication over the WSNs sensor networks need \nprovision of guaranteed specifications for maximum delay, minimum bandwidth or other \nQoS parameters. \n\nChallenges of high QoS are (i) routing through nodes of high throughputs, lower delay \nand paths which use low energy resources, (ii) link and (ii) maintaining the product of \npriority and delay, which means higher priority packets take lower delay paths and lower \npriority packets take higher delay paths. \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n281 \n\nA metric is the coverage of a sensor network. The coverage depends on the density and \nlocations of the nodes in the region, communication range and sensitivity of the nodes. \nAnother metric is percentage of times the network cover occurrence of an event in case of \nsurveillance systems, hazard chemicals or fire-detection systems. \n\nConfiguration \n\nChallenges of configuring in view of resource constraints with the nodes statically or \ndynamically or self-automatic are the following: (i) locations and mobility range of the \nWSN nodes, (ii) clusters, (iii) gateways, (iv) cluster-heads, (v) sampling rate of the sensed \nparameters and (vi) their aggregation, compaction and fusion. \n\nChallenges are to be met with limited battery power, storage, computation capability, \nbandwidth and scalability limit on the nodes. \n\n7.7.5 \nWSN Nodes Secure Communication \n\nSensor networks need secure communication for data privacy \nand integrity. Authentication ensures data from the sensing node \nonly, maintains data integrity and disables the communication \nof messages from unauthenticated sources. Privacy ensures data \nsecrecy and eavesdropping (entering without permission). \n\nBerkeley laboratories suggested SPINS (Security Protocols in Network of Sensors). \nSPINS use the symmetric cryptographic protocol because of the following reasons\u2014an \nasymmetric cryptographic method which has high overhead in term of memory and \ncomputations for digital signatures, key-generation and verification. It also has high \nmemory requirements and communicates higher number of bytes compared to the \nsymmetric method. \n\nSPINS is a suite of security protocols for the sensor networks which are: (i) Secure \nNetwork Encryption Protocol (SNEP) and (ii) micro-Tesla (m-Tesla). SPINS use block \ncipher encryption functions. \n\nSNEP enables secure point-to-point communication. It ensures data privacy and \nintegrity. It secures communication after authentication process. It does not require \nmessage replay, thus message remains fresh. \n\nAccess point distributes session key to A and B using SNEP. Two nodes, A and B, share six \nkeys. The encryption keys, K AB and K BA , Cipher-block-chaining Message Authentication \nCode (MAC) keys, K AB and K BA , and counter keys, C A , C B are the shared keys. MAC \nensures message integrity and privacy. . \n\n\u25cf m -TESLA is light-weight version of TESLA. It enables authenticated broadcasting. The \nauthentication is micro-timed and efficient. It results in stream-loss tolerant secure \nauthentication. \n\nm -TESLA. First a packet is listened and \nconsidered as a parent. It is authenticated later. This makes secure authentication \nstream-loss tolerant. \n\nData privacy and \nintegrity needs and two \n\nprotocols SNEP and \n\n\u03bc-TESLA \n\n282 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nDistributed sensor networks use a key management scheme, which can be (i) based on \nprobabilistic key sharing or (ii) random key pre-distribution key sharing. \n\nLocalised Encryption and Authentication Protocol (LEAP) \n\nDifferent packets when using LEAP use different keying mechanisms. Security needs \ndecide the mechanism. A node uses four keys: individual key, group key, cluster key and \nshare a pair of key with the neighbour. \n\nA challenge for highly-distributed architecture with localised coordination is the \nimplementation of goals of a system for applications and services. \n\nImplementation needs are autonomous operation, self-organisation, self-configuration, \nadaptation, energy conservation at physical, MAC, link, route, application layer, design of \nscalable node density, number and types of networks. \n\nNetwork is data-centric network and route nodes have no addressability. Three \nchallenges, viz. security, QoS and configuring of nodes are as follows: \n\nSecurity \n\nSecurity challenges are: \n\n\u25cf Hello flood attack: An attacker node sends hello messages repeatedly, and thus drains \nthe energy of the attacked node. \n\n\u25cf Sybil attack is an attack where a single node, presents itself as different entities at \ndifferent times. \n\n\u25cf Selective forwarding attack is an attack when the attacker node does not forward the \nattacked node messages on receiving. \n\n\u25cf Sinkhole attack is when an attacked node behaves as an access point and receives the \nmessages without forwarding them. \n\n\u25cf Wormhole attack is an attack where the attacker node gives false information of \ndistances of the destinations, thus forcing the attacked node to take longer paths. The \nlonger path has high latency and thus high delivery delays of packets. \n\n7.7.6 \nWSN IoT Applications \n\nWSNs are increasingly being used as a subsystem in IoT-based applications and services. \nWSN can function as a source of data along with other systems and connect through a \ngateway and access point to the Internet. \n\nAn example of WSN specific IoT application is smart home control and monitoring \nsystem (Sections 1.5.3 and 12.5.1). A connected home has the following applications \ndeployed in a smart home: \n\n1. Mobile, tablets, IP-TV, VOIP telephony, video conferencing, video-on-demand, video- \n\nSurveillance, Wi-Fi and Internet \n2. WSN nodes and wireless actuator nodes, which can be built using ZigBeeIP (Section \n\n2.3.1) are nodes for home security access control and security alerts, lighting control, \n\nSensors, Participatory Sensing, RFIDs and Wireless Sensor Networks \n283 \n\nhome health care, fire detection, leak detection, energy efficiency, solar panel \nmonitoring and control, temperature monitoring and HVAC control and automated \nmeter reading. \nFigure 7.20 shows source-end cluster of ZigBee WSN and actuator nodes, coordinators \nand routers connected through gateway and set of RPL routers for data packets from IPv6 \naddresses and communicating with IoT and M2M IoT applications and services layer for \ndata packets from IPv6 addresses. \n\nGateway \n\nCluster of ZigBee based \nWSN Nodes and Actuators \n\nActuator Nodes \n\nWSN Nodes \n\nActuator \n\nNode \n\nActuator \n\nNode \n\nWSN \nApplication \n\nFramework \n\nIoT Comm. \nFramework \n\nRPL Comm. \n\nFramework \n\nData \nConsolidation \n\nFramework \n\nSource End IPv6 Addresses \n\nApplications \nand Services \n\nLayer \nProtocols \n\nApplications \nSupport  Layer \n\nProtocols \n\nSet of RPL \n\nRouters \n\nData Center/ \n\nCloud/ \nWeb Server \n\nData \nStore \n\nData of all Sensors including WSN Nodes \n\nSource End IPv6 Addresses \n\nNetwork \n\nFigure 7.20 Source-end cluster of ZigBee WSN and actuator nodes, coordinators and routers \n\nconnected through gateway and set of RPL routers for data packets from IPv6 addresses \nand communicating with IoT and M2M IoT applications and services layer \n\nZigBee devices form WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network) devices in home \nnetwork. WSN nodes, coordinating nodes and routing nodes can also use ZigBee protocol \nfor physical layer wireless connectivity. ZigBee is IEEE 802.15.4 standard protocol for \nphysical/data-link layer (Phy/MAC). \n\nZigBee IP is an enhancement for IPv6 connectivity (Section 2.3.1). ZigBee IP is \nenhancement with RFD. RFD (Reduced Function Device) means one that functions for the \n\u2018sleepy\u2019 battery-operated device. Sleepy means one that wakes up infrequently, sends data \n\n284 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nand then goes back to sleep. 6lowpan refers to IPv6 over low power wireless personal area \nnetwork which permits communication of IPv6 packets in a sensor network. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf A set of sensors can be networked using the wireless. They do cooperative monitoring of physical \nor environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or hazardous \ngas-leaks and pollutants, waste containers, home appliances and surveillance systems at different \nlocations. \n\n\u25cf Sound-waves-based surveillance and tracking systems for enemy submarines were used in the 1950s. \nResearch and applications of low power wireless integrated micro-sensors and WSN uses are ongoing \nsince 1998. \n\n\u25cf WSNs are subsystems which connect to the Internet using gateways. The subsystems have a number \nof IoT applications and services, such as for smart homes and smart cities. \n\n\u25cf WSN nodes associate with CMOS low power ASIC or microcontroller circuits, transceiver of adaptable \nradio ranges and coding for processing needs to be energy-efficient. \n\n\u25cf WSN infrastructure can be fixed connecting infrastructure of nodes, coordinators, relays, gateways \nand routers, or an ad-hoc connecting network of mobile WSNs with limited or unspecified mobility \nregion. \n\n\u25cf The architecture of a WSN is according to applications and services. Two basic architectures are \nwireless multi-hop infrastructure network architecture or multi-cluster architecture using clusters, \ncluster gateways, cluster-heads and clusters hierarchy. \n\n\u25cf WSN nodes and gateway do the routing, data aggregation, compaction, fusion and direct diffusion. \n\n\u25cf Network is a data-centric network and route nodes have no addressability. \n\n\u25cf Network nodes use self-discovering, self-configuring and self-healing protocols. \n\n\u25cf Three challenges are the WSN security, QoS and configuring of the nodes. \n\n\u25cf WSN issues are localisation, mobility range, security, data-link and routing protocols, link quality \nindicator, coverage range, and required QoS according to applications and services. \n\n\u25cf A WSN IoT application is smart home control and monitoring system (Sections 1.5.3 and 12.5.1). A \nconnected home has number of applications deployed in the smart home. \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1. How does a wireless sensor circuit differ from that of a sensor? \n2.

Sensors for number of \nphysical environments, parameters and conditions convert physical energy into electrical \nenergy. \n\n\u25cf A complex sensor includes an output processing circuit, which possesses computing and \ncommunication capabilities. Sensing needs the microcontroller for storing, computing and \ncommunication and sensor electronic circuits. \n\n\u25cf Sensors are of two types\u2014analog and digital. Sensors can sense temperature, humidity, \nacceleration, angular acceleration, object distance, orientation angle with respect to a fixed \ndirection, magnetic object proximity, touch and gestures of users, motion, sound, vibrations, \nshocks, electric current and environment conditions. \n\n286 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf Digital sensing needs a circuit to generate 1 or 0 or binary output of 1s and 0s for storing, \ncomputing and communication.
