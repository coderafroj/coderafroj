A variable is a name that refers to a value. \n\n2.1 Assignment statements \n\nAn assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value: >>> message = 'And now for something completely different' >>> n = 17 >>> pi = 3.1415926535897932 This example makes three assignments. The \ufb01rst assigns a string to a new variable named message; the second gives the integer 17 to n; the third assigns the (approximate) value of \u03c0 to pi. \n\nA common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to its value. This kind of \ufb01gure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable\u2019s state of mind). Figure 2.1 shows the result of the previous example. \n\n2.2 Variable names \n\nProgrammers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful\u2014they docu- ment what the variable is used for. \n\nmessage \n\nn \n\npi \n\n17 \n\n\u2019And now for something completely different\u2019 \n\n3.1415926535897932 \n\nFigure 2.1: State diagram. \n\n10 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements \n\nVariable names can be as long as you like. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they can\u2019t begin with a number. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is conventional to use only lower case for variables names. \n\nThe underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as your_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow. \n\nIf you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error: \n\n>>> 76trombones = 'big parade' SyntaxError: invalid syntax >>> more@ = 1000000 SyntaxError: invalid syntax >>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy' SyntaxError: invalid syntax \n\n76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number. more@ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @. But what\u2019s wrong with class? \n\nIt turns out that class is one of Python\u2019s keywords. The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names. \n\nPython 3 has these keywords: \n\nFalse class finally is return None continue for lambda try True def from nonlocal while and del global not with as elif if or yield assert else import pass break except in raise \n\nYou don\u2019t have to memorize this list. In most development environments, keywords are displayed in a different color; if you try to use one as a variable name, you\u2019ll know. \n\n2.3 Expressions and statements \n\nAn expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions: \n\n>>> 42 42 >>> n 17 >>> n + 25 42 \n\nWhen you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluates it, which means that it \ufb01nds the value of the expression. In this example, n has the value 17 and n + 25 has the value 42. \n\nA statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value. \n\n>>> n = 17 >>> print(n) \n\n2.4. Script mode 11 \n\nThe \ufb01rst line is an assignment statement that gives a value to n. The second line is a print statement that displays the value of n. \n\nWhen you type a statement, the interpreter executes it, which means that it does whatever the statement says. In general, statements don\u2019t have values. \n\n2.4 Script mode \n\nSo far we have run Python in interactive mode, which means that you interact directly with the interpreter. Interactive mode is a good way to get started, but if you are working with more than a few lines of code, it can be clumsy. \n\nThe alternative is to save code in a \ufb01le called a script and then run the interpreter in script mode to execute the script. By convention, Python scripts have names that end with .py. \n\nIf you know how to create and run a script on your computer, you are ready to go. Oth- erwise I recommend using PythonAnywhere again. I have posted instructions for running in script mode at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e. \n\nBecause Python provides both modes, you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing. \n\nFor example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type \n\n>>> miles = 26.2 >>> miles * 1.61 42.182 \n\nThe \ufb01rst line assigns a value to miles, but it has no visible effect. The second line is an ex- pression, so the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result. It turns out that a marathon is about 42 kilometers. \n\nBut if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no output at all. In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect. Python evaluates the expression, but it doesn\u2019t display the result. To display the result, you need a print statement like this: \n\nmiles = 26.2 print(miles * 1.61) \n\nThis behavior can be confusing at \ufb01rst. To check your understanding, type the following statements in the Python interpreter and see what they do: \n\n5 x = 5 x + 1 \n\nNow put the same statements in a script and run it. What is the output? Modify the script by transforming each expression into a print statement and then run it again. \n\n2.5 Order of operations \n\nWhen an expression contains more than one operator, the order of evaluation depends on the order of operations. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules: \n\n12 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements \n\n\u2022 Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated \ufb01rst, 2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn\u2019t change the result. \n\n\u2022 Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 * 3**2 is 18, not 36. \n\n\u2022 Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction. So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5. \n\n\u2022 Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponen- tiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, the division happens \ufb01rst and the result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2\u03c0, you can use parentheses or write degrees / 2 / pi. \n\nI don\u2019t work very hard to remember the precedence of operators. If I can\u2019t tell by looking at the expression, I use parentheses to make it obvious. \n\n2.6 String operations \n\nIn general, you can\u2019t perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal: \n\n'chinese'-'food' 'eggs'/'easy' 'third'*'a charm' \n\nBut there are two exceptions, + and *. \n\nThe + operator performs string concatenation, which means it joins the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example: \n\n>>> first = 'throat' >>> second = 'warbler' >>> first + second throatwarbler \n\nThe * operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. For example, 'Spam'*3 is 'SpamSpamSpam'. If one of the values is a string, the other has to be an integer. \n\nThis use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3 is equivalent to 4+4+4, we expect 'Spam'*3 to be the same as 'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam', and it is. On the other hand, there is a signi\ufb01cant way in which string concatenation and repe- tition are different from integer addition and multiplication. Can you think of a property that addition has that string concatenation does not? \n\n2.7 Comments \n\nAs programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more dif\ufb01cult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often dif\ufb01cult to look at a piece of code and \ufb01gure out what it is doing, or why. \n\n2.8. Debugging 13 \n\nFor this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural lan- guage what the program is doing. These notes are called comments, and they start with the # symbol: # compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put comments at the end of a line: percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage of an hour Everything from the # to the end of the line is ignored\u2014it has no effect on the execution of the program. \n\nComments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of the code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can \ufb01gure out what the code does; it is more useful to explain why. \n\nThis comment is redundant with the code and useless: v = 5 # assign 5 to v This comment contains useful information that is not in the code: v = 5 # velocity in meters/second. Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but long names can make com- plex expressions hard to read, so there is a tradeoff. \n\n2.8 Debugging \n\nThree kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors. It is useful to distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly. \n\nSyntax error: \u201cSyntax\u201d refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that struc- ture. For example, parentheses have to come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error. \n\nIf there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python displays an error mes- sage and quits, and you will not be able to run the program. During the \ufb01rst few weeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of time tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will make fewer errors and \ufb01nd them faster. \n\nRuntime error: The second type of error is a runtime error, so called because the error does not appear until after the program has started running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad) has happened. \n\nRuntime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the \ufb01rst few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. \n\nSemantic error: The third type of error is \u201csemantic\u201d, which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it will run without generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing. It will do something else. Speci\ufb01cally, it will do what you told it to do. \n\nIdentifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to \ufb01gure out what it is doing. \n\n14 Chapter 2. Variables, expressions and statements \n\n2.9 Glossary \n\nvariable: A name that refers to a value. \n\nassignment: A statement that assigns a value to a variable. \n\nstate diagram: A graphical representation of a set of variables and the values they refer to. \n\nkeyword: A reserved word that is used to parse a program; you cannot use keywords like if, def, and while as variable names. \n\noperand: One of the values on which an operator operates. \n\nexpression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single re- sult. \n\nevaluate: To simplify an expression by performing the operations in order to yield a single value. \n\nstatement: A section of code that represents a command or action. So far, the statements we have seen are assignments and print statements. \n\nexecute: To run a statement and do what it says. \n\ninteractive mode: A way of using the Python interpreter by typing code at the prompt. \n\nscript mode: A way of using the Python interpreter to read code from a script and run it. \n\nscript: A program stored in a \ufb01le. \n\norder of operations: Rules governing the order in which expressions involving multiple operators and operands are evaluated. \n\nconcatenate: To join two operands end-to-end. \n\ncomment: Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone read- ing the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program. \n\nsyntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore im- possible to interpret). \n\nexception: An error that is detected while the program is running. \n\nsemantics: The meaning of a program. \n\nsemantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended. \n\n2.10 Exercises \n\nExercise 2.1. Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn a new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make errors on purpose to see what goes wrong. \n\n\u2022 We\u2019ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n? \n\n2.10. Exercises 15 \n\n\u2022 How about x = y = 1? \n\n\u2022 In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ;. What happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement? \n\n\u2022 What if you put a period at the end of a statement? \n\n\u2022 In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python? \n\nExercise 2.2. Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator: \n\n1. The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4 \n\n3\u03c0r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? \n\n2. Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the \ufb01rst copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies? \n\n3. If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace (8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at easy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast? \n\n16 Chapter 2.
