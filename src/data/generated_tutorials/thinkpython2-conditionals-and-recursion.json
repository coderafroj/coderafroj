But \ufb01rst I want to introduce two new operators: \ufb02oor division \nand modulus. \n\n5.1 \nFloor division and modulus \n\nThe \ufb02oor division operator, // , divides two numbers and rounds down to an integer. For \nexample, suppose the run time of a movie is 105 minutes. You might want to know how \nlong that is in hours. Conventional division returns a \ufb02oating-point number: \n\n>>> minutes = 105 \n>>> minutes / 60 \n1.75 \n\nBut we don\u2019t normally write hours with decimal points. Floor division returns the integer \nnumber of hours, rounding down: \n\n>>> minutes = 105 \n>>> hours = minutes // 60 \n>>> hours \n1 \n\nTo get the remainder, you could subtract off one hour in minutes: \n\n>>> remainder = minutes - hours * 60 \n>>> remainder \n45 \n\nAn alternative is to use the modulus operator , % , which divides two numbers and returns \nthe remainder. \n\n>>> remainder = minutes % 60 \n>>> remainder \n45 \n\nThe modulus operator is more useful than it seems. For example, you can check whether \none number is divisible by another\u2014if x % y is zero, then x is divisible by y . \n\n40 \nChapter 5. Conditionals and recursion \n\nAlso, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For example, x % 10 \nyields the right-most digit of x (in base 10). Similarly x % 100 yields the last two digits. \n\nIf you are using Python 2, division works differently. The division operator, / , performs \n\ufb02oor division if both operands are integers, and \ufb02oating-point division if either operand is \na float . \n\n5.2 \nBoolean expressions \n\nA boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. The following examples \nuse the operator == , which compares two operands and produces True if they are equal \nand False otherwise: \n\n>>> 5 == 5 \nTrue \n>>> 5 == 6 \nFalse \n\nTrue and False are special values that belong to the type bool ; they are not strings: \n\n>>> type(True) \n<class 'bool'> \n>>> type(False) \n<class 'bool'> \n\nThe == operator is one of the relational operators ; the others are: \n\nx != y \n# x is not equal to y \nx > y \n# x is greater than y \nx < y \n# x is less than y \nx >= y \n# x is greater than or equal to y \nx <= y \n# x is less than or equal to y \n\nAlthough these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different \nfrom the mathematical symbols. A common error is to use a single equal sign ( = ) instead of \na double equal sign ( == ). Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a relational \noperator. There is no such thing as =< or => . \n\n5.3 \nLogical operators \n\nThere are three logical operators : and , or , and not . The semantics (meaning) of these \noperators is similar to their meaning in English. For example, x > 0 and x < 10 is true \nonly if x is greater than 0 and less than 10. \n\nn%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0 is true if either or both of the conditions is true, that is, if the number \nis divisible by 2 or 3. \n\nFinally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not (x > y) is true if x > y is \nfalse, that is, if x is less than or equal to y . \n\nStrictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but \nPython is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as True : \n\n5.4. Conditional execution \n41 \n\n>>> 42 and True \nTrue \n\nThis \ufb02exibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing. \nYou might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing). \n\n5.4 \nConditional execution \n\nIn order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions \nand change the behavior of the program accordingly. Conditional statements give us this \nability. The simplest form is the if statement: \n\nif x > 0: \nprint('x is positive') \n\nThe boolean expression after if is called the condition . If it is true, the indented statement \nruns. If not, nothing happens. \n\nif statements have the same structure as function de\ufb01nitions: a header followed by an \nindented body. Statements like this are called compound statements . \n\nThere is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the body, but there has to \nbe at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to have a body with no statements (usually as a \nplace keeper for code you haven\u2019t written yet). In that case, you can use the pass statement, \nwhich does nothing. \n\nif x < 0: \npass \n# TODO: need to handle negative values! \n\n5.5 \nAlternative execution \n\nA second form of the if statement is \u201calternative execution\u201d, in which there are two possi- \nbilities and the condition determines which one runs. The syntax looks like this: \n\nif x % 2 == 0: \nprint('x is even') \nelse: \nprint('x is odd') \n\nIf the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, then we know that x is even, and the program \ndisplays an appropriate message. If the condition is false, the second set of statements \nruns. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will run. The \nalternatives are called branches , because they are branches in the \ufb02ow of execution. \n\n5.6 \nChained conditionals \n\nSometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. \nOne way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional : \n\n42 \nChapter 5. Conditionals and recursion \n\nif x < y: \nprint('x is less than y') \nelif x > y: \nprint('x is greater than y') \nelse: \nprint('x and y are equal') \n\nelif is an abbreviation of \u201celse if\u201d. Again, exactly one branch will run. There is no limit on \nthe number of elif statements. If there is an else clause, it has to be at the end, but there \ndoesn\u2019t have to be one. \n\nif choice == 'a': \ndraw_a() \nelif choice == 'b': \ndraw_b() \nelif choice == 'c': \ndraw_c() \n\nEach condition is checked in order. If the \ufb01rst is false, the next is checked, and so on. If one \nof them is true, the corresponding branch runs and the statement ends. Even if more than \none condition is true, only the \ufb01rst true branch runs. \n\n5.7 \nNested conditionals \n\nOne conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written the example in \nthe previous section like this: \n\nif x == y: \nprint('x and y are equal') \nelse: \nif x < y: \nprint('x is less than y') \nelse: \nprint('x is greater than y') \n\nThe outer conditional contains two branches. The \ufb01rst branch contains a simple statement. \nThe second branch contains another if statement, which has two branches of its own. \nThose two branches are both simple statements, although they could have been conditional \nstatements as well. \n\nAlthough the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested condi- \ntionals become dif\ufb01cult to read very quickly. It is a good idea to avoid them when you \ncan. \n\nLogical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements. For ex- \nample, we can rewrite the following code using a single conditional: \n\nif 0 < x: \nif x < 10: \nprint('x is a positive single-digit number.') \n\nThe print statement runs only if we make it past both conditionals, so we can get the same \neffect with the and operator: \n\nif 0 < x and x < 10: \nprint('x is a positive single-digit number.') \n\n5.8. Recursion \n43 \n\nFor this kind of condition, Python provides a more concise option: \n\nif 0 < x < 10: \nprint('x is a positive single-digit number.') \n\n5.8 \nRecursion \n\nIt is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a function to call itself. It may \nnot be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical \nthings a program can do. For example, look at the following function: \n\ndef countdown(n): \nif n <= 0: \nprint('Blastoff!') \nelse: \nprint(n) \ncountdown(n-1) \n\nIf n is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, \u201cBlastoff!\u201d Otherwise, it outputs n and then calls \na function named countdown \u2014itself\u2014passing n-1 as an argument. \n\nWhat happens if we call this function like this? \n\n>>> countdown(3) \n\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=3 , and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the \nvalue 3, and then calls itself... \n\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=2 , and since n is greater than 0, it \noutputs the value 2, and then calls itself... \n\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=1 , and since n is greater \nthan 0, it outputs the value 1, and then calls itself... \n\nThe execution of countdown begins with n=0 , and since n is \nnot greater than 0, it outputs the word, \u201cBlastoff!\u201d and then \nreturns. \n\nThe countdown that got n=1 returns. \n\nThe countdown that got n=2 returns. \n\nThe countdown that got n=3 returns. \n\nAnd then you\u2019re back in __main__ . So, the total output looks like this: \n\n3 \n2 \n1 \nBlastoff! \n\nA function that calls itself is recursive ; the process of executing it is called recursion . \n\nAs another example, we can write a function that prints a string n times. \n\ndef print_n(s, n): \nif n <= 0: \nreturn \nprint(s) \nprint_n(s, n-1) \n\n44 \nChapter 5. Conditionals and recursion \n\n__main__ \n\ncountdown \n\ncountdown \n\ncountdown \n\ncountdown \n\nn \n3 \n\nn \n2 \n\nn \n1 \n\nn \n0 \n\nFigure 5.1: Stack diagram. \n\nIf n <= 0 the return statement exits the function. The \ufb02ow of execution immediately re- \nturns to the caller, and the remaining lines of the function don\u2019t run. \n\nThe rest of the function is similar to countdown : it displays s and then calls itself to display \ns n \u2212 1 additional times. So the number of lines of output is 1 + (n - 1) , which adds up \nto n . \n\nFor simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a for loop. But we will see \nexamples later that are hard to write with a for loop and easy to write with recursion, so it \nis good to start early. \n\n5.9 \nStack diagrams for recursive functions \n\nIn Section 3.9, we used a stack diagram to represent the state of a program during a function \ncall. The same kind of diagram can help interpret a recursive function. \n\nEvery time a function gets called, Python creates a frame to contain the function\u2019s local \nvariables and parameters. For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on \nthe stack at the same time. \n\nFigure 5.1 shows a stack diagram for countdown called with n = 3 . \n\nAs usual, the top of the stack is the frame for __main__ . It is empty because we did not \ncreate any variables in __main__ or pass any arguments to it. \n\nThe four countdown frames have different values for the parameter n . The bottom of the \nstack, where n=0 , is called the base case . It does not make a recursive call, so there are no \nmore frames. \n\nAs an exercise, draw a stack diagram for print_n called with s = 'Hello' and n=2 . Then \nwrite a function called do_n that takes a function object and a number, n , as arguments, and \nthat calls the given function n times. \n\n5.10 \nIn\ufb01nite recursion \n\nIf a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the \nprogram never terminates. This is known as in\ufb01nite recursion , and it is generally not a \ngood idea. Here is a minimal program with an in\ufb01nite recursion: \n\n5.11. Keyboard input \n45 \n\ndef recurse(): \nrecurse() \nIn most programming environments, a program with in\ufb01nite recursion does not really run \nforever. Python reports an error message when the maximum recursion depth is reached: \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in recurse \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in recurse \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in recurse \n. \n. \n. \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 2, in recurse \nRuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded \nThis traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the previous chapter. When the error \noccurs, there are 1000 recurse frames on the stack! \n\nIf you encounter an in\ufb01nite recursion by accident, review your function to con\ufb01rm that \nthere is a base case that does not make a recursive call. And if there is a base case, check \nwhether you are guaranteed to reach it. \n\n5.11 \nKeyboard input \n\nThe programs we have written so far accept no input from the user. They just do the same \nthing every time. \n\nPython provides a built-in function called input that stops the program and waits for the \nuser to type something. When the user presses Return or Enter , the program resumes and \ninput returns what the user typed as a string. In Python 2, the same function is called \nraw_input . \n>>> text = input() \nWhat are you waiting for? \n>>> text \n'What are you waiting for?' \nBefore getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt telling the user what \nto type. input can take a prompt as an argument: \n>>> name = input('What...is your name?\\n') \nWhat...is your name? \nArthur, King of the Britons! \n>>> name \n'Arthur, King of the Britons!' \nThe sequence \\n at the end of the prompt represents a newline , which is a special character \nthat causes a line break. That\u2019s why the user\u2019s input appears below the prompt. \n\nIf you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to int : \n>>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\\n' \n>>> speed = input(prompt) \nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? \n42 \n>>> int(speed) \n42 \n\n46 \nChapter 5. Conditionals and recursion \n\nBut if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error: \n>>> speed = input(prompt) \nWhat...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? \nWhat do you mean, an African or a European swallow? \n>>> int(speed) \nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10 \nWe will see how to handle this kind of error later. \n\n5.12 \nDebugging \n\nWhen a syntax or runtime error occurs, the error message contains a lot of information, but \nit can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are usually: \n\n\u2022 What kind of error it was, and \n\n\u2022 Where it occurred. \n\nSyntax errors are usually easy to \ufb01nd, but there are a few gotchas. Whitespace errors can \nbe tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them. \n>>> x = 5 \n>>> \ny = 6 \nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1 \ny = 6 \n^ \nIndentationError: unexpected indent \nIn this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one space. But the error \nmessage points to y , which is misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the \nproblem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a \nprevious line. \n\nThe same is true of runtime errors. Suppose you are trying to compute a signal-to-noise \nratio in decibels. The formula is SNR db = 10 log 10 ( P signal / P noise ) . In Python, you might \nwrite something like this: \nimport math \nsignal_power = 9 \nnoise_power = 10 \nratio = signal_power // noise_power \ndecibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio) \nprint(decibels) \nWhen you run this program, you get an exception: \nTraceback (most recent call last): \nFile \"snr.py\", line 5, in ? \ndecibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio) \nValueError: math domain error \nThe error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing wrong with that line. To \ufb01nd the \nreal error, it might be useful to print the value of ratio , which turns out to be 0. The \nproblem is in line 4, which uses \ufb02oor division instead of \ufb02oating-point division. \n\nYou should take the time to read error messages carefully, but don\u2019t assume that everything \nthey say is correct. \n\n5.13. Glossary \n47 \n\n5.13 \nGlossary \n\n\ufb02oor division: An operator, denoted // , that divides two numbers and rounds down (to- \nward negative in\ufb01nity) to an integer. \n\nmodulus operator: An operator, denoted with a percent sign ( % ), that works on integers \nand returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. \n\nboolean expression: An expression whose value is either True or False . \n\nrelational operator: One of the operators that compares its operands: == , != , > , < , >= , and \n<= . \n\nlogical operator: One of the operators that combines boolean expressions: and , or , and \nnot . \n\nconditional statement: A statement that controls the \ufb02ow of execution depending on some \ncondition. \n\ncondition: The boolean expression in a conditional statement that determines which \nbranch runs. \n\ncompound statement: A statement that consists of a header and a body. The header ends \nwith a colon (:). The body is indented relative to the header. \n\nbranch: One of the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statement. \n\nchained conditional: A conditional statement with a series of alternative branches. \n\nnested conditional: A conditional statement that appears in one of the branches of another \nconditional statement. \n\nreturn statement: A statement that causes a function to end immediately and return to the \ncaller. \n\nrecursion: The process of calling the function that is currently executing. \n\nbase case: A conditional branch in a recursive function that does not make a recursive call. \n\nin\ufb01nite recursion: A recursion that doesn\u2019t have a base case, or never reaches it. Eventu- \nally, an in\ufb01nite recursion causes a runtime error. \n\n5.14 \nExercises \n\nExercise 5.1. The time module provides a function, also named time , that returns the current \nGreenwich Mean Time in \u201cthe epoch\u201d, which is an arbitrary time used as a reference point. On \nUNIX systems, the epoch is 1 January 1970. \n\n>>> import time \n>>> time.time() \n1437746094.5735958 \n\nWrite a script that reads the current time and converts it to a time of day in hours, minutes, and \nseconds, plus the number of days since the epoch. \n\n48 \nChapter 5. Conditionals and recursion \n\nExercise 5.2. Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers a, b, and c such that \n\na n + b n = c n \n\nfor any values of n greater than 2. \n\n1. Write a function named check_fermat that takes four parameters\u2014 a , b , c and n \u2014and \nchecks to see if Fermat\u2019s theorem holds. If n is greater than 2 and \n\na n + b n = c n \n\nthe program should print, \u201cHoly smokes, Fermat was wrong!\u201d Otherwise the program should \nprint, \u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d \n\n2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for a , b , c and n , converts them to \nintegers, and uses check_fermat to check whether they violate Fermat\u2019s theorem. \n\nExercise 5.3. If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange them in a triangle. \nFor example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long and the other two are one inch long, you will not \nbe able to get the short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to \nsee if it is possible to form a triangle: \n\nIf any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two, then you cannot \nform a triangle. Otherwise, you can. (If the sum of two lengths equals the third, they \nform what is called a \u201cdegenerate\u201d triangle.) \n\n1. Write a function named is_triangle that takes three integers as arguments, and that prints \neither \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d, depending on whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks \nwith the given lengths. \n\n2. Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths, converts them to integers, \nand uses is_triangle to check whether sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle. \n\nExercise 5.4. What is the output of the following program? Draw a stack diagram that shows the \nstate of the program when it prints the result. \n\ndef recurse(n, s): \nif n == 0: \nprint(s) \nelse: \nrecurse(n-1, n+s) \n\nrecurse(3, 0) \n\n1. What would happen if you called this function like this: recurse(-1, 0) ? \n\n2. Write a docstring that explains everything someone would need to know in order to use this \nfunction (and nothing else). \n\nThe following exercises use the turtle module, described in Chapter 4: \nExercise 5.5. Read the following function and see if you can \ufb01gure out what it does (see the exam- \nples in Chapter 4). Then run it and see if you got it right. \n\n5.14. Exercises \n49 \n\nFigure 5.2: A Koch curve. \n\ndef draw(t, length, n): \nif n == 0: \nreturn \nangle = 50 \nt.fd(length*n) \nt.lt(angle) \ndraw(t, length, n-1) \nt.rt(2*angle) \ndraw(t, length, n-1) \nt.lt(angle) \nt.bk(length*n) \nExercise 5.6. The Koch curve is a fractal that looks something like Figure 5.2. To draw a Koch \ncurve with length x, all you have to do is \n\n1. Draw a Koch curve with length x /3 . \n\n2. Turn left 60 degrees. \n\n3. Draw a Koch curve with length x /3 . \n\n4. Turn right 120 degrees. \n\n5. Draw a Koch curve with length x /3 . \n\n6. Turn left 60 degrees. \n\n7. Draw a Koch curve with length x /3 . \n\nThe exception is if x is less than 3: in that case, you can just draw a straight line with length x. \n\n1. Write a function called koch that takes a turtle and a length as parameters, and that uses the \nturtle to draw a Koch curve with the given length. \n\n2. Write a function called snowflake that draws three Koch curves to make the outline of a \nsnow\ufb02ake. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ koch. py . \n\n3. The Koch curve can be generalized in several ways. See http: // en. wikipedia. org/ \nwiki/ Koch_ snowflake for examples and implement your favorite. \n\n50 \nChapter 5.
