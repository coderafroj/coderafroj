  "content": "# Tuples\n\n\n\nThis chapter presents one more built-in type, the tuple, and then shows how lists, dictionar- \nies, and tuples work together. I also present a useful feature for variable-length argument \nlists, the gather and scatter operators. \n\nOne note: there is no consensus on how to pronounce \u201ctuple\u201d. Some people say \u201ctuh- \nple\u201d, which rhymes with \u201csupple\u201d. But in the context of programming, most people say \n\u201ctoo-ple\u201d, which rhymes with \u201cquadruple\u201d. \n\n12.1 \nTuples are immutable \n\nA tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by \nintegers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples \nare immutable. \n\nSyntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values: \n\n>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' \n\nAlthough it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses: \n\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') \n\nTo create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a \ufb01nal comma: \n\n>>> t1 = 'a', \n>>> type(t1) \n<class 'tuple'> \n\nA value in parentheses is not a tuple: \n\n>>> t2 = ('a') \n>>> type(t2) \n<class 'str'> \n\nAnother way to create a tuple is the built-in function tuple . With no argument, it creates \nan empty tuple: \n\n>>> t = tuple() \n>>> t \n() \n\n116 \nChapter 12. Tuples \n\nIf the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result is a tuple with the elements of \nthe sequence: \n\n>>> t = tuple('lupins') \n>>> t \n('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's') \n\nBecause tuple is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable \nname. \n\nMost list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element: \n\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') \n>>> t[0] \n'a' \n\nAnd the slice operator selects a range of elements. \n\n>>> t[1:3] \n('b', 'c') \n\nBut if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error: \n\n>>> t[0] = 'A' \nTypeError: object doesn't support item assignment \n\nBecause tuples are immutable, you can\u2019t modify the elements. But you can replace one \ntuple with another: \n\n>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:] \n>>> t \n('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') \n\nThis statement makes a new tuple and then makes t refer to it. \n\nThe relational operators work with tuples and other sequences; Python starts by comparing \nthe \ufb01rst element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements, and \nso on, until it \ufb01nds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if \nthey are really big). \n\n>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4) \nTrue \n>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4) \nTrue \n\n12.2 \nTuple assignment \n\nIt is often useful to swap the values of two variables. With conventional assignments, you \nhave to use a temporary variable. For example, to swap a and b : \n\n>>> temp = a \n>>> a = b \n>>> b = temp \n\nThis solution is cumbersome; tuple assignment is more elegant: \n\n>>> a, b = b, a \n\n12.3. Tuples as return values \n117 \n\nThe left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value \nis assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated \nbefore any of the assignments. \n\nThe number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the \nsame: \n\n>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3 \nValueError: too many values to unpack \n\nMore generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list or tuple). For exam- \nple, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write: \n\n>>> addr = 'monty@python.org' \n>>> uname, domain = addr.split('@') \n\nThe return value from split is a list with two elements; the \ufb01rst element is assigned to \nuname , the second to domain . \n\n>>> uname \n'monty' \n>>> domain \n'python.org' \n\n12.3 \nTuples as return values \n\nStrictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, the effect \nis the same as returning multiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers \nand compute the quotient and remainder, it is inef\ufb01cient to compute x//y and then x%y . It \nis better to compute them both at the same time. \n\nThe built-in function divmod takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values, the \nquotient and remainder. You can store the result as a tuple: \n\n>>> t = divmod(7, 3) \n>>> t \n(2, 1) \n\nOr use tuple assignment to store the elements separately: \n\n>>> quot, rem = divmod(7, 3) \n>>> quot \n2 \n>>> rem \n1 \n\nHere is an example of a function that returns a tuple: \n\ndef min_max(t): \nreturn min(t), max(t) \n\nmax and min are built-in functions that \ufb01nd the largest and smallest elements of a sequence. \nmin_max computes both and returns a tuple of two values. \n\n118 \nChapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.4 \nVariable-length argument tuples \n\nFunctions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter name that begins with \n* gathers arguments into a tuple. For example, printall takes any number of arguments \nand prints them: \n\ndef printall(*args): \nprint(args) \n\nThe gather parameter can have any name you like, but args is conventional. Here\u2019s how \nthe function works: \n\n>>> printall(1, 2.0, '3') \n(1, 2.0, '3') \n\nThe complement of gather is scatter . If you have a sequence of values and you want to pass \nit to a function as multiple arguments, you can use the * operator. For example, divmod \ntakes exactly two arguments; it doesn\u2019t work with a tuple: \n\n>>> t = (7, 3) \n>>> divmod(t) \nTypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1 \n\nBut if you scatter the tuple, it works: \n\n>>> divmod(*t) \n(2, 1) \n\nMany of the built-in functions use variable-length argument tuples. For example, max and \nmin can take any number of arguments: \n\n>>> max(1, 2, 3) \n3 \n\nBut sum does not. \n\n>>> sum(1, 2, 3) \nTypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3 \n\nAs an exercise, write a function called sum_all that takes any number of arguments and \nreturns their sum. \n\n12.5 \nLists and tuples \n\nzip is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and interleaves them. The name \nof the function refers to a zipper, which interleaves two rows of teeth. \n\nThis example zips a string and a list: \n\n>>> s = 'abc' \n>>> t = [0, 1, 2] \n>>> zip(s, t) \n<zip object at 0x7f7d0a9e7c48> \n\nThe result is a zip object that knows how to iterate through the pairs. The most common \nuse of zip is in a for loop: \n\n12.5. Lists and tuples \n119 \n\n>>> for pair in zip(s, t): \n... \nprint(pair) \n... \n('a', 0) \n('b', 1) \n('c', 2) \n\nA zip object is a kind of iterator , which is any object that iterates through a sequence. \nIterators are similar to lists in some ways, but unlike lists, you can\u2019t use an index to select \nan element from an iterator. \n\nIf you want to use list operators and methods, you can use a zip object to make a list: \n\n>>> list(zip(s, t)) \n[('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)] \n\nThe result is a list of tuples; in this example, each tuple contains a character from the string \nand the corresponding element from the list. \n\nIf the sequences are not the same length, the result has the length of the shorter one. \n\n>>> list(zip('Anne', 'Elk')) \n[('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')] \n\nYou can use tuple assignment in a for loop to traverse a list of tuples: \n\nt = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)] \nfor letter, number in t: \nprint(number, letter) \n\nEach time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in the list and assigns the ele- \nments to letter and number . The output of this loop is: \n\n0 a \n1 b \n2 c \n\nIf you combine zip , for and tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two \n(or more) sequences at the same time. For example, has_match takes two sequences, t1 \nand t2 , and returns True if there is an index i such that t1[i] == t2[i] : \n\ndef has_match(t1, t2): \nfor x, y in zip(t1, t2): \nif x == y: \nreturn True \nreturn False \n\nIf you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in \nfunction enumerate : \n\nfor index, element in enumerate('abc'): \nprint(index, element) \n\nThe result from enumerate is an enumerate object, which iterates a sequence of pairs; each \npair contains an index (starting from 0) and an element from the given sequence. In this \nexample, the output is \n\n0 a \n1 b \n2 c \n\nAgain. \n\n120 \nChapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.6 \nDictionaries and tuples \n\nDictionaries have a method called items that returns a sequence of tuples, where each \ntuple is a key-value pair. \n\n>>> d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2} \n>>> t = d.items() \n>>> t \ndict_items([('c', 2), ('a', 0), ('b', 1)]) \n\nThe result is a dict_items object, which is an iterator that iterates the key-value pairs. You \ncan use it in a for loop like this: \n\n>>> for key, value in d.items(): \n... \nprint(key, value) \n... \nc 2 \na 0 \nb 1 \n\nAs you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order. \n\nGoing in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to initialize a new dictionary: \n\n>>> t = [('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)] \n>>> d = dict(t) \n>>> d \n{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} \n\nCombining dict with zip yields a concise way to create a dictionary: \n\n>>> d = dict(zip('abc', range(3))) \n>>> d \n{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} \n\nThe dictionary method update also takes a list of tuples and adds them, as key-value pairs, \nto an existing dictionary. \n\nIt is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because you can\u2019t use lists). For \nexample, a telephone directory might map from last-name, \ufb01rst-name pairs to telephone \nnumbers. Assuming that we have de\ufb01ned last , first and number , we could write: \n\ndirectory[last, first] = number \n\nThe expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment to traverse this dic- \ntionary. \n\nfor last, first in directory: \nprint(first, last, directory[last,first]) \n\nThis loop traverses the keys in directory , which are tuples. It assigns the elements of each \ntuple to last and first , then prints the name and corresponding telephone number. \n\nThere are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more detailed version \nshows the indices and elements just as they appear in a list. \nFor example, the tuple \n('Cleese', 'John') would appear as in Figure 12.1. \n\nBut in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the details. For example, a diagram of \nthe telephone directory might appear as in Figure 12.2. \n\nHere the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical shorthand. The telephone \nnumber in the diagram is the complaints line for the BBC, so please don\u2019t call it. \n\n12.7.

To avoid enumerating the possible \ncombinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences. \n\nIn many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and tuples) can be used \ninterchangeably. So how should you choose one over the others? \n\nTo start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the ele- \nments have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the \ncharacters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of \ncharacters instead. \n\nLists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few \ncases where you might prefer tuples: \n\n1. In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple \nthan a list. \n\n2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type \nlike a tuple or string. \n\n3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the \npotential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing. \n\nBecause tuples are immutable, they don\u2019t provide methods like sort and reverse , which \nmodify existing lists. But Python provides the built-in function sorted , which takes any \nsequence and returns a new list with the same elements in sorted order, and reversed , \nwhich takes a sequence and returns an iterator that traverses the list in reverse order. \n\n122 \nChapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.8 \nDebugging \n\nLists, dictionaries and tuples are examples of data structures ; in this chapter we are starting \nto see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, or dictionaries that contain tuples as \nkeys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what \nI call shape errors ; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or \nstructure. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain \nold integer (not in a list), it won\u2019t work. \n\nTo help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module called structshape that \nprovides a function, also called structshape , that takes any kind of data structure as \nan argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape. You can download it from \nhttps://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py \n\nHere\u2019s the result for a simple list: \n\n>>> from structshape import structshape \n>>> t = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> structshape(t) \n'list of 3 int' \n\nA fancier program might write \u201clist of 3 int s \u201d, but it was easier not to deal with plurals. \nHere\u2019s a list of lists: \n\n>>> t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]] \n>>> structshape(t2) \n'list of 3 list of 2 int' \n\nIf the elements of the list are not the same type, structshape groups them, in order, by \ntype: \n\n>>> t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9] \n>>> structshape(t3) \n'list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)' \n\nHere\u2019s a list of tuples: \n\n>>> s = 'abc' \n>>> lt = list(zip(t, s)) \n>>> structshape(lt) \n'list of 3 tuple of (int, str)' \n\nAnd here\u2019s a dictionary with 3 items that map integers to strings. \n\n>>> d = dict(lt) \n>>> structshape(d) \n'dict of 3 int->str' \n\nIf you are having trouble keeping track of your data structures, structshape can help. \n\n12.9 \nGlossary \n\ntuple: An immutable sequence of elements. \n\ntuple assignment: An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of vari- \nables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the \nvariables on the left. \n\n12.10. Exercises \n123 \n\ngather: An operation that collects multiple arguments into a tuple. \n\nscatter: An operation that makes a sequence behave like multiple arguments. \n\nzip object: The result of calling a built-in function zip ; an object that iterates through a \nsequence of tuples. \n\niterator: An object that can iterate through a sequence, but which does not provide list \noperators and methods. \n\ndata structure: A collection of related values, often organized in lists, dictionaries, tuples, \netc. \n\nshape error: An error caused because a value has the wrong shape; that is, the wrong type \nor size. \n\n12.10 \nExercises \n\nExercise 12.1. Write a function called most_frequent that takes a string and prints the let- \nters in decreasing order of frequency. Find text samples from several different languages and see \nhow letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with the tables at http: \n// en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Letter_ frequencies . \nSolution: https: // thinkpython. \ncom/ code/ most_ frequent. py . \nExercise 12.2. More anagrams! \n\n1. Write a program that reads a word list from a \ufb01le (see Section 9.1) and prints all the sets of \nwords that are anagrams. \n\nHere is an example of what the output might look like: \n\n['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled'] \n['retainers', 'ternaries'] \n['generating', 'greatening'] \n['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless'] \n\nHint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of letters to a list \nof words that can be spelled with those letters. The question is, how can you represent the \ncollection of letters in a way that can be used as a key? \n\n2. Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list of anagrams \ufb01rst, followed by \nthe second longest, and so on. \n\n3. In Scrabble a \u201cbingo\u201d is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along with a letter on \nthe board, to form an eight-letter word. What collection of 8 letters forms the most possible \nbingos? \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ anagram_ sets. py . \n\nExercise 12.3. Two words form a \u201cmetathesis pair\u201d if you can transform one into the other by \nswapping two letters; for example, \u201cconverse\u201d and \u201cconserve\u201d. Write a program that \ufb01nds all of \nthe metathesis pairs in the dictionary. Hint: don\u2019t test all pairs of words, and don\u2019t test all possible \nswaps. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ metathesis. py . Credit: This exercise \nis inspired by an example at http: // puzzlers. org . \n\n124 \nChapter 12. Tuples \n\nExercise 12.4. Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler ( http: // www. cartalk. com/ content/ \npuzzlers ): \n\nWhat is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its \nletters one at a time? \n\nNow, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you can\u2019t rearrange any \nof the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If \nyou do that, you\u2019re eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going \nto be an English word\u2014one that\u2019s found in the dictionary. I want to know what\u2019s the \nlongest word and how many letters does it have? \n\nI\u2019m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite, \nyou take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we\u2019re left \nwith the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we\u2019re left with spit, we take the s off, \nwe\u2019re left with pit, it, and I. \n\nWrite a program to \ufb01nd all words that can be reduced in this way, and then \ufb01nd the longest one. \n\nThis exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions: \n\n1. You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that \ncan be formed by removing one letter. These are the \u201cchildren\u201d of the word. \n\n2. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can \nconsider the empty string reducible. \n\n3. The wordlist I provided, words.txt , doesn\u2019t contain single letter words. So you might want \nto add \u201cI\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, and the empty string. \n\n4. To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are \nknown to be reducible. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ reducible. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 13\n\n\n",
