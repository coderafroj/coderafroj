  "content": "# Tuples\n\n\n\nThis chapter presents one more built-in type, the tuple, and then shows how lists, dictionar- ies, and tuples work together. I also present a useful feature for variable-length argument lists, the gather and scatter operators. \n\nOne note: there is no consensus on how to pronounce \u201ctuple\u201d. Some people say \u201ctuh- ple\u201d, which rhymes with \u201csupple\u201d. But in the context of programming, most people say \u201ctoo-ple\u201d, which rhymes with \u201cquadruple\u201d. \n\n12.1 Tuples are immutable \n\nA tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and they are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot like lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable. \n\nSyntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values: \n\n>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' \n\nAlthough it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in parentheses: \n\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') \n\nTo create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a \ufb01nal comma: \n\n>>> t1 = 'a', >>> type(t1) <class 'tuple'> \n\nA value in parentheses is not a tuple: \n\n>>> t2 = ('a') >>> type(t2) <class 'str'> \n\nAnother way to create a tuple is the built-in function tuple. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple: \n\n>>> t = tuple() >>> t () \n\n116 Chapter 12. Tuples \n\nIf the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result is a tuple with the elements of the sequence: \n\n>>> t = tuple('lupins') >>> t ('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's') \n\nBecause tuple is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name. \n\nMost list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an element: \n\n>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') >>> t[0] 'a' \n\nAnd the slice operator selects a range of elements. \n\n>>> t[1:3] ('b', 'c') \n\nBut if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an error: \n\n>>> t[0] = 'A' TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment \n\nBecause tuples are immutable, you can\u2019t modify the elements. But you can replace one tuple with another: \n\n>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:] >>> t ('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') \n\nThis statement makes a new tuple and then makes t refer to it. \n\nThe relational operators work with tuples and other sequences; Python starts by comparing the \ufb01rst element from each sequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements, and so on, until it \ufb01nds elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if they are really big). \n\n>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4) True >>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4) True \n\n12.2 Tuple assignment \n\nIt is often useful to swap the values of two variables. With conventional assignments, you have to use a temporary variable. For example, to swap a and b: \n\n>>> temp = a >>> a = b >>> b = temp \n\nThis solution is cumbersome; tuple assignment is more elegant: \n\n>>> a, b = b, a \n\n12.3. Tuples as return values 117 \n\nThe left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value is assigned to its respective variable. All the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the assignments. \n\nThe number of variables on the left and the number of values on the right have to be the same: \n\n>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3 ValueError: too many values to unpack \n\nMore generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string, list or tuple). For exam- ple, to split an email address into a user name and a domain, you could write: \n\n>>> addr = 'monty@python.org' >>> uname, domain = addr.split('@') \n\nThe return value from split is a list with two elements; the \ufb01rst element is assigned to uname, the second to domain. \n\n>>> uname 'monty' >>> domain 'python.org' \n\n12.3 Tuples as return values \n\nStrictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but if the value is a tuple, the effect is the same as returning multiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers and compute the quotient and remainder, it is inef\ufb01cient to compute x//y and then x%y. It is better to compute them both at the same time. \n\nThe built-in function divmod takes two arguments and returns a tuple of two values, the quotient and remainder. You can store the result as a tuple: \n\n>>> t = divmod(7, 3) >>> t (2, 1) \n\nOr use tuple assignment to store the elements separately: \n\n>>> quot, rem = divmod(7, 3) >>> quot 2 >>> rem 1 \n\nHere is an example of a function that returns a tuple: \n\ndef min_max(t): return min(t), max(t) \n\nmax and min are built-in functions that \ufb01nd the largest and smallest elements of a sequence. min_max computes both and returns a tuple of two values. \n\n118 Chapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.4 Variable-length argument tuples \n\nFunctions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter name that begins with * gathers arguments into a tuple. For example, printall takes any number of arguments and prints them: \n\ndef printall(*args): print(args) \n\nThe gather parameter can have any name you like, but args is conventional. Here\u2019s how the function works: \n\n>>> printall(1, 2.0, '3') (1, 2.0, '3') \n\nThe complement of gather is scatter. If you have a sequence of values and you want to pass it to a function as multiple arguments, you can use the * operator. For example, divmod takes exactly two arguments; it doesn\u2019t work with a tuple: \n\n>>> t = (7, 3) >>> divmod(t) TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1 \n\nBut if you scatter the tuple, it works: \n\n>>> divmod(*t) (2, 1) \n\nMany of the built-in functions use variable-length argument tuples. For example, max and min can take any number of arguments: \n\n>>> max(1, 2, 3) 3 \n\nBut sum does not. \n\n>>> sum(1, 2, 3) TypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3 \n\nAs an exercise, write a function called sum_all that takes any number of arguments and returns their sum. \n\n12.5 Lists and tuples \n\nzip is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and interleaves them. The name of the function refers to a zipper, which interleaves two rows of teeth. \n\nThis example zips a string and a list: \n\n>>> s = 'abc' >>> t = [0, 1, 2] >>> zip(s, t) <zip object at 0x7f7d0a9e7c48> \n\nThe result is a zip object that knows how to iterate through the pairs. The most common use of zip is in a for loop: \n\n12.5. Lists and tuples 119 \n\n>>> for pair in zip(s, t): ... print(pair) ... ('a', 0) ('b', 1) ('c', 2) \n\nA zip object is a kind of iterator, which is any object that iterates through a sequence. Iterators are similar to lists in some ways, but unlike lists, you can\u2019t use an index to select an element from an iterator. \n\nIf you want to use list operators and methods, you can use a zip object to make a list: \n\n>>> list(zip(s, t)) [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)] \n\nThe result is a list of tuples; in this example, each tuple contains a character from the string and the corresponding element from the list. \n\nIf the sequences are not the same length, the result has the length of the shorter one. \n\n>>> list(zip('Anne', 'Elk')) [('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')] \n\nYou can use tuple assignment in a for loop to traverse a list of tuples: \n\nt = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)] for letter, number in t: print(number, letter) \n\nEach time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in the list and assigns the ele- ments to letter and number. The output of this loop is: \n\n0 a 1 b 2 c \n\nIf you combine zip, for and tuple assignment, you get a useful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same time. For example, has_match takes two sequences, t1 and t2, and returns True if there is an index i such that t1[i] == t2[i]: \n\ndef has_match(t1, t2): for x, y in zip(t1, t2): if x == y: return True return False \n\nIf you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their indices, you can use the built-in function enumerate: \n\nfor index, element in enumerate('abc'): print(index, element) \n\nThe result from enumerate is an enumerate object, which iterates a sequence of pairs; each pair contains an index (starting from 0) and an element from the given sequence. In this example, the output is \n\n0 a 1 b 2 c \n\nAgain. \n\n120 Chapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.6 Dictionaries and tuples \n\nDictionaries have a method called items that returns a sequence of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair. \n\n>>> d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2} >>> t = d.items() >>> t dict_items([('c', 2), ('a', 0), ('b', 1)]) \n\nThe result is a dict_items object, which is an iterator that iterates the key-value pairs. You can use it in a for loop like this: \n\n>>> for key, value in d.items(): ... print(key, value) ... c 2 a 0 b 1 \n\nAs you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no particular order. \n\nGoing in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to initialize a new dictionary: \n\n>>> t = [('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)] >>> d = dict(t) >>> d {'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} \n\nCombining dict with zip yields a concise way to create a dictionary: \n\n>>> d = dict(zip('abc', range(3))) >>> d {'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} \n\nThe dictionary method update also takes a list of tuples and adds them, as key-value pairs, to an existing dictionary. \n\nIt is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because you can\u2019t use lists). For example, a telephone directory might map from last-name, \ufb01rst-name pairs to telephone numbers. Assuming that we have de\ufb01ned last, first and number, we could write: \n\ndirectory[last, first] = number \n\nThe expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment to traverse this dic- tionary. \n\nfor last, first in directory: print(first, last, directory[last,first]) \n\nThis loop traverses the keys in directory, which are tuples. It assigns the elements of each tuple to last and first, then prints the name and corresponding telephone number. \n\nThere are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more detailed version shows the indices and elements just as they appear in a list. For example, the tuple ('Cleese', 'John') would appear as in Figure 12.1. \n\nBut in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the details. For example, a diagram of the telephone directory might appear as in Figure 12.2. \n\nHere the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical shorthand. The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line for the BBC, so please don\u2019t call it. \n\n12.7.

To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences. \n\nIn many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how should you choose one over the others? \n\nTo start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences because the ele- ments have to be characters. They are also immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters instead. \n\nLists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples: \n\n1. In some contexts, like a return statement, it is syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. \n\n2. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use an immutable type like a tuple or string. \n\n3. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing. \n\nBecause tuples are immutable, they don\u2019t provide methods like sort and reverse, which modify existing lists. But Python provides the built-in function sorted, which takes any sequence and returns a new list with the same elements in sorted order, and reversed, which takes a sequence and returns an iterator that traverses the list in reverse order. \n\n122 Chapter 12. Tuples \n\n12.8 Debugging \n\nLists, dictionaries and tuples are examples of data structures; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data structures, like lists of tuples, or dictionaries that contain tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but they are prone to what I call shape errors; that is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or structure. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won\u2019t work. \n\nTo help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module called structshape that provides a function, also called structshape, that takes any kind of data structure as an argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape. You can download it from https://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py \n\nHere\u2019s the result for a simple list: \n\n>>> from structshape import structshape >>> t = [1, 2, 3] >>> structshape(t) 'list of 3 int' \n\nA fancier program might write \u201clist of 3 ints\u201d, but it was easier not to deal with plurals. Here\u2019s a list of lists: \n\n>>> t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]] >>> structshape(t2) 'list of 3 list of 2 int' \n\nIf the elements of the list are not the same type, structshape groups them, in order, by type: \n\n>>> t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9] >>> structshape(t3) 'list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)' \n\nHere\u2019s a list of tuples: \n\n>>> s = 'abc' >>> lt = list(zip(t, s)) >>> structshape(lt) 'list of 3 tuple of (int, str)' \n\nAnd here\u2019s a dictionary with 3 items that map integers to strings. \n\n>>> d = dict(lt) >>> structshape(d) 'dict of 3 int->str' \n\nIf you are having trouble keeping track of your data structures, structshape can help. \n\n12.9 Glossary \n\ntuple: An immutable sequence of elements. \n\ntuple assignment: An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of vari- ables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the variables on the left. \n\n12.10. Exercises 123 \n\ngather: An operation that collects multiple arguments into a tuple. \n\nscatter: An operation that makes a sequence behave like multiple arguments. \n\nzip object: The result of calling a built-in function zip; an object that iterates through a sequence of tuples. \n\niterator: An object that can iterate through a sequence, but which does not provide list operators and methods. \n\ndata structure: A collection of related values, often organized in lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc. \n\nshape error: An error caused because a value has the wrong shape; that is, the wrong type or size. \n\n12.10 Exercises \n\nExercise 12.1. Write a function called most_frequent that takes a string and prints the let- ters in decreasing order of frequency. Find text samples from several different languages and see how letter frequency varies between languages. Compare your results with the tables at http: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Letter_ frequencies . Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ most_ frequent. py . Exercise 12.2. More anagrams! \n\n1. Write a program that reads a word list from a \ufb01le (see Section 9.1) and prints all the sets of words that are anagrams. \n\nHere is an example of what the output might look like: \n\n['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled'] ['retainers', 'ternaries'] ['generating', 'greatening'] ['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless'] \n\nHint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a collection of letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those letters. The question is, how can you represent the collection of letters in a way that can be used as a key? \n\n2. Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list of anagrams \ufb01rst, followed by the second longest, and so on. \n\n3. In Scrabble a \u201cbingo\u201d is when you play all seven tiles in your rack, along with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter word. What collection of 8 letters forms the most possible bingos? \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ anagram_ sets. py . \n\nExercise 12.3. Two words form a \u201cmetathesis pair\u201d if you can transform one into the other by swapping two letters; for example, \u201cconverse\u201d and \u201cconserve\u201d. Write a program that \ufb01nds all of the metathesis pairs in the dictionary. Hint: don\u2019t test all pairs of words, and don\u2019t test all possible swaps. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ metathesis. py . Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at http: // puzzlers. org . \n\n124 Chapter 12. Tuples \n\nExercise 12.4. Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler (http: // www. cartalk. com/ content/ puzzlers ): \n\nWhat is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its letters one at a time? \n\nNow, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you can\u2019t rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If you do that, you\u2019re eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an English word\u2014one that\u2019s found in the dictionary. I want to know what\u2019s the longest word and how many letters does it have? \n\nI\u2019m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we\u2019re left with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we\u2019re left with spit, we take the s off, we\u2019re left with pit, it, and I. \n\nWrite a program to \ufb01nd all words that can be reduced in this way, and then \ufb01nd the longest one. \n\nThis exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions: \n\n1. You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one letter. These are the \u201cchildren\u201d of the word. \n\n2. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible. \n\n3. The wordlist I provided, words.txt, doesn\u2019t contain single letter words. So you might want to add \u201cI\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, and the empty string. \n\n4. To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are known to be reducible. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ reducible. py . \n\n\n## Chapter 13\n\n\n",
