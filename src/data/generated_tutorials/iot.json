CIoT nodes equipped with sensors can act as CoAP \nservers or clients running Erbium, which is a lightweight implementa- \ntion of CoAP. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p341_i0.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p341_i1.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p341_i2.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p341_i3.png)\n7.3 Vision and Architecture \n331 \n\nProtocol Translation \n\nSOs Delegate \n\nService Discovery \n\nResource Directory \n\nIoT \nHUB \n\nApplication layer \n\nInternet \n\nMQTT \nHTTP \nCoAP \n\nTCP \n\nIEEE 802.11 \nIEEE 802.15.4 \nIEEE 802.3 \n\nUDP \n\nIPv4 & IPv6 + 6LoWPAN \nLink Layer \n\nFigure 7.12 The WoTT architecture and protocol stack with emphasis on the role \nof the IoT Hub in the management of the testbed\u2019s heterogeneous network. \n\nAs the CIoT nodes, SBC nodes can act as CoAP clients or servers, \nwith fewer constraints than implementations on SBCs. For example, \non Arduino Y\u00fan nodes, a Javascript application initializes a CoAP \nserver on an instance of node.js. Intel Galileo boards and Raspberry Pi \nsystems can support di\ufb00erent languages, ranging from Python to Java. \nThe WoTT testbed, shown in Figure 7.12, is heterogeneous by \ndesign, in order to enable smart objects to communicate seamlessly \nwith each other and to enable communications between the WoTT \nand external Internet elements (e.g., the cloud, Internet hosts, or con- \nsumers). Internet protocol (in particular, IPv6 or IPv6 + 6LoWPAN) \nis universally considered a key communication enabler for the future \nIoT. For this reason, the WoTT adopts IP as a common network \nsubstrate, thus allowing for simple integration with the existing Inter- \nnet world. Figure 7.12 shows the IP-based protocol stack supported \nby the WoTT. It is worth noting that all nodes in the WoTT use \nstandard protocols at all layers of the protocol stack. As can be seen, \nseveral physical (PHY) and MAC protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11, IEEE \n802.15.4, and IEEE 802.3) as well as application layer protocols can \nbe used. The architecture also introduces an innovative network \nelement, called the IoT Hub, which operates at di\ufb00erent layers of the \nprotocol stack in order to further enhance the interoperability among \ncommunicating devices, by integrating several networks into a single \nIP-based substrate and, at the same time, by implementing important \nfunctions at the application layer. Due to their greater capabilities, in \n\n332 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nterms of computational power and networking, SBC nodes can be \nused e\ufb00ectively to implement all the functions of an IoT Hub. \nThe Wi-Fi networking infrastructure is based on Cisco Connected \nMobile Experiences (CMX) 14 and access points, which have already \nbeen installed in the WoTT buildings and can be used to track devices \n(for indoor localization purposes). In particular, the CMX platform \nprovides mobility services REST APIs, which allow developers to \nenable service customization with location information in mobile \napplications, such as location-aware equipment tracking, guest access, \nand device-based services. This feature is currently used to build \nuser-location-aware IoT applications, which can \u201ctrack and follow\u201d \nthe user throughout the the WoTT building, enabling speci\ufb01c and \naugmented interactions with the surrounding environment. \nFocusing on the application layer, the WoTT currently supports \nCoAP, MQTT, and HTTP. CoAP is a binary and lightweight web \ntransfer protocol built on top of UDP and follows a request/response \nparadigm [7]. CoAP has been explicitly designed to work with \ndevices operating in low-power and lossy networks. MQTT is also a \nlightweight publish/subscribe protocol suitable for constrained smart \nobjects, such as sensors or actuators, and runs on top of TCP. Finally, \nHTTP is mainly used for communication between the WoTT and \nexternal Internet actors or consumers, such as cloud storage services \nor IoT-unaware clients. We note that, among the WoTT components, \nthe IoT Hub is the key IoT enabler, as it manages the di\ufb00erent access \ntechnologies and supports full IP connectivity among all objects. \nBy implementing various functionalities at the application layer, all \nprotocols listed in Figure 7.12 can coexist in the same environment. \nWe also note that the software for smart objects has been developed \nwith di\ufb00erent programming languages. This underlines once more \nthat, thanks to the features provided at the application layer, develop- \ners can create new IoT applications easily and without any constraint \nexcept for compliance with IoT standards. \n\n7.3.2 \nEnabling Interactions with Smart Objects through \nthe IoT Hub \n\nThe WoTT does not simply enable communications between the IoT \nactors; it represents a \u201cuniform\u201d super-entity, able to provide enhanced \n\n14 Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/ \nsolutions/enterprise-networks/connected-mobile-experiences/ \nindex.html . \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture \n333 \n\nfunctionalities that go beyond the mere union of the features provided \nby its components. As shown in Figure 7.12, in order to achieve this \nholistic vision, the WoTT introduces a new and innovative network \nelement, called an IoT Hub (as presented in Section 6.6), which acts as \na gateway that can bridge and merge several networks, using various \ncommunication technologies, into a single IP network. \nThe IoT Hub also implements several functions at the application \nlayer: it manages the services and resources available in the overall \ninfrastructure, thus playing a key role at this layer too. The use of an \nIoT Hub is expedient for several reasons. The extreme heterogeneity of \nIoT devices requires mechanisms for their management and the seam- \nless interaction of humans and smart objects. Moreover, focusing on \ndata collection, due to their limited capabilities smart objects may not \nbe able to handle large numbers of concurrent requests, thus making it \npreferable to limit direct access to them. In other cases, extremely lim- \nited devices might act as clients to implement data collection behavior. \nE\ufb00orts have been made to standardize the design of IoT Hubs. \nA relevant example is HyperCat [232], which introduces standard \nspeci\ufb01cations to allow servers to expose JSON-based hypermedia cat- \nalogues as collections of URLs. Thus, IoT clients are able to discover, \nusing REST methods, data available on servers in HTTPS and JSON \nformat. Unlike the IoT Hub of the WoTT, HyperCat works at a higher \nlevel of abstraction, as it is intended to allow reasoning and service \ncomposition based on IoT concepts, and does not take into account \ndirect interactions with constrained devices, where speci\ufb01c protocols \n(e.g., CoAP) should be adopted to minimize energy and memory \nconsumption. \nFrom a networking standpoint, the IoT Hub is a fog node [205], \nplaced at the edge of multiple physical networks with the goal of cre- \nating an IP-based IoT network. The IoT Hub plays a fundamental role \nby implementing the following functions at the link and application \nlayers of the protocol stack: \n\n\u2022 Border router : the IoT Hub bridges one or more networks (e.g., sev- \neral IEEE 802.15.4 networks). \n\u2022 Service and resource discovery : the IoT Hub is able to discover the \nsmart objects available in the network and their hosted resources. \n\u2022 Resource directory (RD): the IoT Hub complies with the relevant \nspeci\ufb01cations [14], and maintains a list of all resources available in \nthe bridged networks creating a centralized entry point for applica- \ntions that need to perform resource lookup. \n\n334 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\n\u2022 Origin server (OS): the IoT Hub provides a CoAP server that hosts \nthe smart object\u2019s resources. \n\u2022 CoAP-to-CoAP (C2C) proxy : the IoT Hub provides proxying \ncapabilities for CoAP requests from external clients targeting \nconstrained nodes. \n\u2022 HTTP-to-CoAP (H2C) proxy : the IoT Hub provides HTTP-to-CoAP \ncross-proxying (i.e., protocol translation) in order to allow HTTP \nclients to access to CoAP resources. \n\u2022 Cache : the IoT Hub keeps a cache with a representation of most \nrecently accessed resources in order to act as a smart object dele- \ngate, minimizing latency and reducing load on constrained devices. \n\nBy adopting standard mechanisms and communication protocols, \nsmart objects do not depend on the IoT Hub for their operation; in \naddition, the IoT Hub is able to mitigate the presence of non-standard \ncomponents that might not interoperate with standard-compliant \ndevices. It is important to point out that the presence of the IoT Hub \nis not mandatory for interaction and interoperability, but its presence \nextends the IoT network and increases its capabilities, by simplifying \nand hiding complex and important tasks such as service discovery \nand routing. \n\n7.3.2.1 \nIntegration Challenges \nThe main challenges encountered in the deployment of the WoTT are \nrelated to design: the de\ufb01nition of the di\ufb00erent elements and their \nfunctionalities, the representation of the di\ufb00erent resources and their \nrelationships through suitable hypermedia, and maintenance of com- \npatibility with standards. \nThe e\ufb00orts devoted to the design of the WoTT, together with the \nIoT Hub and the use of standards, has simpli\ufb01ed the deployment \nprocess, making the integration of all di\ufb00erent elements straightfor- \nward, notwithstanding their heterogeneity. In particular, the WoTT \nhides critical implementation issues encountered at lower layers. For \nexample, in a constrained network (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4) the resource \nadvertisement feature is critical, requiring strict assumptions about \nenergy and memory consumption on each constrained device. In \nSection 4.4, the advertisement of nodes belonging to the network was \nanalyzed, and we derived a multicast solution that allows a reduction \nin energy consumption. The end users (application-oriented) of the \nWoTT are not concerned with these implementation details. \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture \n335 \n\nAnother implementation challenge that is hidden from end users \nwas the creation of IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and the con\ufb01guration of \nnetworks elements (e.g., routers and access points), in order to create a \nunique IP-addressable network. The \ufb01rmware provided with common \nnetwork elements typically does not allow these unusual con\ufb01gura- \ntions. To overcome this limitation, the WoTT network components \nhave been \ufb02ashed with more customizable and advanced \ufb01rmware, \nsuch as Tomato. 15 \n\n7.3.3 \nTestbed Access and Security \n\nWith its goal of becoming a publicly available platform, the WoTT \ncomplies with security policies and mechanisms, adopting strong \ndefense measures in order to counteract security threats. These \nthreats may come from external environments, as well as from mali- \ncious internal IoT entities. The experience gained from the years of \ndevelopment of the web provides useful security technologies and \nmechanisms that can be taken as a reference and applied to enhance \nthe protection and reliability of IoT environments. \nWith access by external clients, the WoTT is able to manage and \nauthenticate request issuers, de\ufb01ning at the same time processing poli- \ncies and rules. To comply with these speci\ufb01cations, the WoTT allows \nexternal connections through VPN and SSH tunnels, using credentials \nissued by WoTT administrators. \nSeveral security mechanisms for smart object interaction are \nimplemented within the testbed. TLS (in conjunction with HTTP) \nand DTLS (the secure transport for CoAP) are implemented on a \nset of devices that host resources that need to be accessed through \nsecured application protocols. The IoT Hub implements both security \nprotocols in order to provide secure resource access through proxying. \nOf course, end-to-end security through proxying cannot be ensured, \nas no TLS-to-DTLS mapping is de\ufb01ned. \n\n7.3.3.1 \nThe Role of Authorization \nWhile DTLS and TLS are implemented to enforce con\ufb01dentiality and \nauthenticity of communication between endpoints, real-world IoT \nsystems must be able to manage multiple users accessing the resources \ndeployed in a smart environment. This is when authorization comes \n\n15 Tomato \ufb01rmware: http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato . \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p346_i0.png)\n336 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\ninto the picture: mechanisms must be de\ufb01ned in order to ensure \nthat only authorized parties can interact with objects. For example, \nin a multi-occupant building hosting the WoTT, o\ufb03ces should be \nable to be unlocked only by those who have been granted access and \nnot just to anyone who has discovered a \u201csmart lock\u201d. Even though \nauthorization is obviously a critical issue, research has not yet focused \non de\ufb01ning mechanisms to grant authorization and manage access \npolicies in IoT scenarios. In order to take this issue into account, \nthe WoTT implements an authorization architecture based on the \nOAuth protocol, called IoT-OAS (see Section 5.3.2). This architecture \nimplements a lightweight delegation approach to authorization. \n\n7.3.4 \nExploiting the Testbed: WoT Applications for Mobile \nand Wearable Devices \n\nThanks to the high-level of abstraction and full interoperability of the \nWoTT, web, mobile, and wearable WoT applications have been devel- \noped using it (Figure 7.13). Due to the need to \ufb01ll the gap between the \nmobile/wearable world and the IoT, it is important to de\ufb01ne innovative \ninteraction patterns, through which developers might build, deploy, \nand connect their applications so that these can be used in a simple \nway by end users. To validate the bene\ufb01ts of the WoTT and demon- \nstrate the ease of integration of a newly deployed application with the \ntestbed, wearable-enabled and mobile-oriented applications have been \n\nWeb \n\nWearable \n\nMobile \n\nFigure 7.13 Web, mobile, and wearable REST-based testbed applications. \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture \n337 \n\ndeveloped with the goal to start interacting with \u201cthings\u201d in a natural \nway, similar to what a person experiences everyday on the web. \nThanks to their portability, wearable and mobile devices are attrac- \ntive ways to track people\u2019s actions in the real world. Indoor localization \nfeatures have been developed in the WoTT, using triangulation tech- \nniques implemented through the CMX access points. The availability \nof localization APIs in the Cisco CMX system allows applications \nto be built that take into account the location and movement of \nusers throughout a building. This is an extremely interesting feature, \nwhich can pave the way for development of applications that can \nactually follow the user and even anticipate their movements in \nthe building. Together with access-point-based localization, the use \nof on-board inertial measurement units can further improve the \ntracking capability. \nMobile devices play an important role in our architecture. Besides \ninteracting with the deployed smart objects, they can also act as smart \nobjects, providing data generated by their onboard sensors. Mobile \ndevices can thus be considered as WoTT nodes, making the WoTT \na highly dynamic and evolving system. \nBy providing a uniform and application-oriented platform, the \nWoTT can be used e\ufb00ectively by developers to create and test real- \nworld IoT applications easily and in short time, thus making the \nWoTT more attractive than other currently available platforms. This \nis made possible by the ready-to-use capabilities and the direct/active \ninteractions that a deployed application may have with the resources \navailables into the WoTT. From an operational point of view, devel- \nopers only have to run their applications involving testbed resources, \nwithout any additional need to virtualize environment services, and \nbecoming part of a WoT scenario, in which consumers are not only \n\u201creaders\u201d, but active participants. \nBased on the capabilities provided by the WoTT, we have developed \na mobile and wearable application (Figure 7.13), which recreates the \nbasic steps envisioned for a WoT application that can really be used by \nanyone. These applications have been tested on the Android Wear plat- \nform using LG G watches and Android 5.0.1 smartphones. In the near \nfuture, as more and more smart objects are deployed, vendor-provided \napps will no longer be the typical means to interact with things: a more \nstandard approach will be needed in order to do so e\ufb00ectively. \nThe developed application performs the following steps. The mobile \ndevice \ufb01rst discovers smart objects in its proximity, proactively \n\n338 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nand reactively, by means of standard service discovery and resource \ndirectory mechanisms, and then forwards the collected information to \nits connected wearable device interface. Through wearable interfaces, \na user can see and browse a list of all the resources that have been \ndiscovered and select one to interact with. Interactions are performed \naccording to the function set speci\ufb01ed by the selected smart object \n(e.g., a light bulb might provide an on/o\ufb00switch, while a temperature \nsensor might just provide a way to read its value). Resources and \ninteractions are revealed gradually, according to the REST paradigm, \nso that the application can adapt itself dynamically. \nWe note that WoTT resources can be deployed on di\ufb00erent plat- \nforms (e.g., di\ufb00erent smart objects) and using heterogeneous proto- \ncols. However, this is completely transparent to a developer, who can \naccess all these resources, only constrained by the need to use stan- \ndard protocols. This possibility is granted by the IoT Hub\u2019s abstraction \nability and is not a feature of other existing testbeds (e.g., SmartSan- \ntander). \nA user can interact with smart objects through one of the following \napproaches: \n\n\u2022 Polling allows the user to retrieve the value associated with the \nqueried resource, by performing a CoAP GET request. \n\u2022 Observing can be used to receive asynchronous updates when the \nvalue of the speci\ufb01ed resource changes, adopting an e\ufb03cient mech- \nanism and avoiding the need for periodic data polling. \n\u2022 Acting is used to set the value of a speci\ufb01ed resource, depending on \nthe function set provided by the resource. \n\nThe observing approach, which was not de\ufb01ned in HTTP, is a \nlightweight CoAP-oriented interaction mechanism [9]. Resource \nobserving is achieved by ussuing a CoAP GET request containing \nan Observe option. This option instructs the target smart object to \nadd a new subscriber, which will receive, in push mode, subsequent \nresource updates. Subscribers also have the ability to stop observing a \nresource at any time, by unsubscribing from updates. \n\n7.3.5 \nOpen Challenges and Future Vision \n\nThe use of standard protocols, the use of well-known web-based \napproaches, and the widespread di\ufb00usion of hardware platforms are \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture \n339 \n\nchanging and opening the IoT world to new developers, businesses, \nand users. Against this dynamic and evolving background, the avail- \nability of real and accessible resource-oriented testbeds that allow \nactive and direct interaction with low-level nodes and services is \none of the key enablers for the future adoption of the IoT by a \nbroad audience, and even for the \ufb01nal transition from the IoT to \nthe WoT. \nThe ongoing WoTT experience provides a concrete example of \nnew architectural and networking solutions that address important \nopen issues and challenges for the IoT. The experience gained in \ndesigning and implementing our testbed has con\ufb01rmed that there is a \nconcrete need for open evaluation platforms aimed at integrating and \nexperimenting with innovative solutions, in order to develop appli- \ncations that can really bridge today\u2019s gap between users and things. \nThe heterogeneity (in terms of hardware and software) of our testbed, \ntesti\ufb01es to how the proper use of standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, \nCoAP, and MQTT) and interaction paradigms and approaches (such \nas REST and service/resource discovery), are fundamental to creating \ntransparent and dynamic interactions among multiple smart objects \nand personal user devices, such as smartphones and wearables. \nMoreover, this heterogeneity can be extended, with limited e\ufb00ort, by \nimproving the IoT Hub features (e.g., adding support for Bluetooth \ndevices). This would open up the WoTT to a new emerging category \nof IoT-enabled devices, namely Bluetooth Low Energy, thus allowing \nits integration with other service discovery mechanisms, such as \nUriBeacon. 16 \n\nNevertheless, important open issues still need to be tackled to \nbring the IoT into our daily life. Security, interoperability, data pro- \ncessing, human interaction, and easy development and deployment \nare the keywords that will characterize academic and industrial R&D \nactivities over the next few years. IoT-application-oriented testbeds \nrepresent the perfect experimental playgrounds to boost and support \ndevelopment of IoT applications, creating a common space that \ndevelopers, hardware manufacturers, and companies can exploit in \norder to reach the goal of making the IoT accessible and easy to use \nfor everyone, just as the Internet is right now. \n\n16 The UriBeacon Open Standard, (Apr 2015) http://uribeacon.org . \n\n340 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\n7.4 \nWearable Computing for the IoT: \nInteraction Patterns with Smart Objects in \nRESTful Environments \n\nOver the next few years, the IoT is expected to become a reality, merg- \ning the social world, the physical world, and the cyber world to enable \nnew applications and forms of interactions between humans and con- \nnected smart sensing/actuating devices. As billions of smart objects \nwill be deployed in the environment, users should be able to discover \nand interact with objects in their proximity in a seamless and transpar- \nent way. While smartphones have become an extremely popular com- \nputing device, the advent of smart wearable devices, such as Google \nGlass and the Apple Watch, has provided even more e\ufb00ective means \nto bridge the gap between humans and smart objects. In this section, \nwe analyze the characteristics of wearable applications for IoT scenar- \nios and describe the interaction patterns that should occur between \nwearable/mobile devices and smart objects. \n\n7.4.1 \nShaping the Internet of Things in a Mobile-Centric \nWorld \n\nIn recent decades, the Internet has allowed people to access and \nconsume services on a global scale, using traditional hosts and always- \nconnected mobile devices, such as their smartphones, typically using \nthe World Wide Web. By connecting objects and devices, the IoT \nwill fully exploit the potential of networking and enable innovative \nservices to be o\ufb00ered in a wide range of scenarios, such as home and \nbuilding automation, smart cities, and healthcare, integrating new \nparadigms for human-to-machine (H2M) and machine-to-machine \n(M2M) interactions. Many IoT applications will allow people to inter- \nact with smart environments, allowing them to obtain information \nand to change the environment according to their needs and prefer- \nences, sometimes without actually being in the loop. IoT applications \nwill take advantage of the wide di\ufb00usion and pervasive deployment \nof smart objects: tiny devices equipped with a microcontroller, a \ncommunication interface (wired or wireless), a power supply, and \na set of sensors and/or actuators to be used to interface with the \nsurrounding environment. \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT \n341 \n\nSeveral players are developing innovative IoT-related products in a \nvariety of \ufb01elds, which are starting to reach end-users, who are now \nbecoming aware of the integration of physical and cyber worlds. The \n\u201cgold rush\u201d of the IoT-era, driven, on one hand, by developers\u2019 will \nto demonstrate the feasibility of interconnecting everyday devices to \npeople and, on the other hand, by their hope to turn their custom solu- \ntions into standards for the general public, has created a plethora of \nclosed vertical solutions. This is leading to a highly fragmented market: \na babel of incompatible solutions, as opposite to a highly standardized \nand interoperable environment, which is what the Internet (of Things) \nshould be [231]. In order to prevent the IoT reaching a dead end due to \nfragmentation caused by these vertical solutions, much e\ufb00ort has been \nexpended in research projects and standardization organizations, such \nas IEEE, IETF, and the IPSO Alliance. \nThe successful model for communication represented by the Web \nhas been considered as a reference point for the IoT as well. We can \nnow assume that the IoT will be a network of heterogeneous intercon- \nnected devices; this will be the infrastructure for the WoT. \nMobile devices (smartphones and tablets) have become the most \npopular computing devices in the world, topping the per-capita rate of \npenetration of personal computers for the \ufb01rst time in mid-2012 [233]. \nWe are living in a mobile-centric world, characterized by symbiosis \nand interdependence between users and their mobile devices, to the \npoint where one cannot work without the other. Thanks to their rich \ncapabilities, mobile devices are handy and ready-to-use gateways to all \nIoT objects deployed nearby or far away: a cyber-\u201cSwiss-army knife\u201d \nfor the IoT. This ease of access be enhanced further by the evolution \nof wearable computing, which has the potential to augment the ways \npeople interact with services (e.g., through voice control, gestures, or \ntouch) or provide information to services (e.g., heart rate monitoring, \n\ufb01tness applications). The smartphone is the enabler for a user who \nwants to control and interact with smart objects in his proximity and \nwearable devices. Interaction with smart objects through wearable \ndevices will represent a quantum leap towards the full integration of \nthe social world, the cyber world, and the physical world, and will be, \nin fact, a milestone for the widespread adoption of the IoT. The interac- \ntion between wearable devices and IoT objects should occur through \nwell-de\ufb01ned patterns, which must take into account their nature, \nwhile providing maximum usability and the best user experience. \n\n342 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\n7.4.2 \nInteraction Patterns with Smart Objects through \nWearable Devices \n\nThe evolution of mobile and wearable computing has changed the way \npeople use online services. They are now always connected, whether \nat home or on the go. In this context, there is a concrete need to \ufb01ll the \ngap between mobile devices and the IoT. A paradigm shift in speci\ufb01c \naspects is needed to let people access and use the IoT with the same \nsimplicity as when accessing the Internet and, possibly, to enable new \nand more natural forms of interactions, which will broaden the range \nof IoT users. \n\n7.4.2.1 \nSmart Object Communication Principles \nThe idea of an IP-based IoT has been around for years and is now \nconsidered as a fact. The adoption of the IP protocol for smart object \naddressing and communication is the driver to full interoperability and \nintegrability of the IoT with the existing Internet. In particular, the \nuse of IPv6 has been foreseen as the solution to the management of \nbillions of globally-addressable devices. A fundamental principle that \nhas driven IoT research and the work of standardization institutions \nis the maximization of the reuse of standard Internet protocols and \nmechanisms. Due to the limitations of low-performance IoT devices, \nit is not always possible to use the traditional TCP/IP protocol stack. \nNew energy-e\ufb03cient and low-overhead communication protocols and \ndata formats, which take into account group communication, mobil- \nity, and interactions among multiple devices, have been designed. The \nintroduction of 6LoWPAN has solved the problem of bringing IP to \nlow-power devices. Thanks to the de\ufb01nition of common standards, the \nIoT is ready to reach the next level: the Web of Things (WoT). \nThe Web is by far the most popular and familiar interaction model \non the Internet. The WoT is being designed around well-known \nconcepts and practices derived from the Web, such as the REST \nparadigm. The REST paradigm was introduced to loosely couple \nclient applications with the systems that they interact with and to \nsupport long-term evolution of systems and provide robustness. \nAt the application layer, CoAP has been designated as the standard \nprotocol for the WoT, similar to the role of HTTP for the Web. In fact, \nCoAP has been designed to work with HTTP, to which it maps easily \nfor integration purposes, by inheriting from it the identi\ufb01cation of \nresources through URIs, the request/response communication model, \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT \n343 \n\nand the semantics of its methods. However, it is not possible to fully \nmap CoAP to HTTP for a number of reasons. In particular, CoAP is a \nbinary UDP-based protocol, while HTTP implies connection-oriented \ncommunications. CoAP also introduces some signi\ufb01cant enhance- \nments and optimizations that are relevant for low-power devices, \nsuch as support for group communication and resource observation. \nThis latter feature allows client applications, after an initial request, to \nreceive updates for a given resource in successive response messages, \nwithout the need to perform periodic polling. Resource observation \nintroduces a new communication paradigm within REST. Note that \nREST is not the only communication pattern that is ever going to \nbe adopted in the IoT, similarly to what happens on the traditional \nInternet: protocols using publish/subscribe mechanisms \ufb01t well when \na single source delivers information to multiple receivers. \n\n7.4.2.2 \nInteraction Patterns \nA smartphone is required when using wearable devices: it is responsi- \nble for performing all the heavy duty and complex tasks (notably pro- \ncessing and communication). Wearable devices are, in fact, extensions \nof a mobile devices, the latter acting as central hubs. In order to enable \ntruly seamless and practical interaction with smart objects through \nwearable devices, it is crucial that the smartphone takes care of these \ntasks behind the scenes. In smart environments, wearable devices will \nthus play the role of true enabler of natural interactions with things, \nwhich is what people expect. As pointed out by Sergey Brin in a TED \ntalk at the time of the launch of the Google Glass, the use of smart- \nphones isolates people, making them constantly and obsessively look- \ning down at their devices [234]. The Google Glass (and, in general, \nany wearable device) should let people keep their heads up, instead, \nthus allowing for simpler and more natural interactions. This change \nis going to have an even bigger impact when users start interacting \nwith a myriad of smart objects, rather than just texting or checking \nemails. \nWearable devices can be classi\ufb01ed into two categories. Passive \nwearables do not require any direct human interaction (e.g., heart rate \nmonitors and step counters) and are therefore tightly coupled with a \nmobile device hosting a custom app to control them. Active wearables \n(e.g., smart watches and glasses) provide information to users and \ncan be used as sources of input, for control of the wearable itself and \nalso the mobile device they are connected to. As a consequence, they \n\n344 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nList \n\nSocial World \nCyber World \n\nPhysical World \n\nDetail \n\nGet \n\nObserve \n\nUpdate \n\nFigure 7.14 Interaction patterns between wearable devices and smart objects. \n\ncan extend their reach to other devices, which can be located in their \nproximity or at a distance. For our purposes, we focus exclusively on \nactive wearables, as they should be the drivers of interactions with \nsmart objects. \nFigure 7.14 shows the interaction patterns that we envision between \nhumans, using wearable devices, and smart objects that may be around \nthem. As described above, smartphones and wearable devices are the \nbridge between the social world (users), the cyber world (networked \nhosts), and the physical world (connected smart objects). Typically, \nthere are some questions that users might ask when trying to interact \nwith a smart environment: \n\n1) What objects are around me? \n2) Do I have the right privileges to control or interact with it directly? \n3) What is a given object? What can it do and what can I do with it? \n4) How can I interact with it? \n\nIn order to answer the above questions and provide a natural \nsequence of interactions, we have envisioned an operational \ufb02ow, \nwhich can be summarized as follows: \n\n\u2022 The smartphone discovers the smart objects in its proxim- \nity (Q1) for which the user has been granted the appropriate \naccess privileges (Q2), by means of suitable service discovery \n(e.g., ZeroConf, as presented in Section 4.3, or low-power radio \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT \n345 \n\nbeacon broadcasting) and resource discovery (e.g., CoAP resource \ndirectory) mechanisms, and presents this information on the \nwearable device interface. \n\u2022 The user can select one item (using vocal input or touch) and \nget detailed information related to the selected resource, com- \nbining the information retrieved in the previous step with other \ndescriptors that can be retrieved on the \ufb02y, such as the function \nset that can be used to operate the resource [55] or a custom user \ninterface (Q3). \n\u2022 The user can then browse through the available forms of interac- \ntion with the selected resource, through specialized interfaces for \nthe possible actions that can be performed (Q4). \n\u2022 The user interacts with the resources, always using the smartphone \nas a bridge to perform the actual communication with smart \nobjects, adopting one of the following methods: \n\u2013 Get : this method allows the user to retrieve the value associ- \nated with the resource, by performing a CoAP GET request (e.g., \nto check the status \u2013 closed or open \u2013 of a smart-lock-equipped \ndoor). \n\u2013 Observe : this method employs an e\ufb03cient mechanism for \nreceiving asynchronous updates when the value of a resource \nchanges, thus avoiding having to periodically poll for data [55]. \nThis is achieved by performing a CoAP GET request containing \nan Observe option to instruct the object to send updates. An \nobserve relation can be then torn down at any time (e.g., to \nmonitor the temperature of a room so that a thermostat can be \nactivated). \n\u2013 Update : this method is used to act upon a resource to set its the \nvalue, by performing a CoAP POST or PUT request, depending \non the function set provided by the resource (e.g., to switch lights \non or of). \n\nThe use of CoAP is not strictly required: the presence of cross- \nproxies, which might perform protocol translation, can enable the \nsame interactions with CoAP-unaware clients that may use HTTP. \n\n7.4.3 \nImplementation in a Real-world IoT Testbed \n\nFollowing the interaction patterns described above, a wearable-based \napplication for interacting with smart objects has been implemented \n\n346 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nand tested within an IoT testbed deployed inside our department, \nwith 70 IP-addressable devices running CoAP servers that host \nsensing and actuating resources. The IoT testbed consists of several \ntypes of nodes, which di\ufb00er in terms of computational capabilities \nand radio access interfaces. The considered nodes can be grouped \ninto two main classes: 36 constrained IoT nodes and 34 single board \ncomputer (SBC) nodes. \nThe constrained IoT nodes are Class 1 devices, according to the ter- \nminology introduced in RFC 7228 [229], based on the Contiki oper- \nating system and using IEEE 802.15.4 radio. Speci\ufb01cally, the following \nconstrained IoT nodes were used: \n\n\u2022 6 TelosB 17 \n\n\u2022 20 Zolertia Z1 18 \n\n\u2022 10 OpenMote-CC2538. 19 \n\nThe SBC nodes are Class 2 devices, typically running a Linux operating \nsystem and with multiple network interfaces. Speci\ufb01cally, the follow- \ning SBC nodes were used: \n\n\u2022 20 Intel Galileo 20 \n\n\u2022 5 Raspberry Pi Model B 21 \n\n\u2022 5 Arduino Y\u00fan 22 (dual Linux/Arduino environment) \n\u2022 4 UDOO 23 (dual Linux/Arduino environment). \n\nThe IoT testbed is purposely heterogeneous in order to simulate the \nexpected real-world IoT conditions, characterized by an extremely \nhigh degree of diversity of smart objects. It also highlights how the use \nof standard communication protocols and mechanisms, combined \nwith our envisioned operational \ufb02ow, can enforce interoperability and \ne\ufb00ective interactions among applications, in a real WoT fashion. \nThe mobile/wearable application was developed on the Android \nWear \nplatform \nusing \nLG \nG \nwatches \nand \nAndroid \nLollipop \nsmartphones.

The smartphone is the \ngateway between the smart objects and wearable devices, as shown \nin Figure 7.14. The communication between the smartphone and the \nsmart objects occurs using CoAP, which is based on the Californium \nlibrary [94]. The smartphone application (SA) communicates with \nthe wearable companion application (WA) using the Android Wear- \nable Data Layer API, which uses Bluetooth for communication. At \nstartup (step 1), SA performs resource discovery using a combined \nmechanism: \n\n\u2022 using ZeroConf, it discovers CoAP servers, whose lists of resources \nare then retrieved by performing a GET request to the /.well- \nknown/core URI; \n\u2022 a multicast GET request to the /.well-known/core URI is sent \nto all smart objects in the network, which return their lists of hosted \nresources. \n\n348 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nAfter the SA has gathered the list of all available resources, it \npushes this information to the WA (step 2), which presents the list \nof resources to the user (View 1). The user selects a resource of \ninterest, and is presented with a dedicated detail view of that resource \n(step 3), which includes resource-speci\ufb01c information, such as its \nhuman-readable name and type (View 2). According to the interface \nof the resource [55], the WA presents (in a 2D picker) swipeable cards \nthat contain action buttons, which can trigger interactions with the \nresource, using the previously described Get, Observe, and Update \nschemes (Views 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively). Upon user selection (for \ninstance, in Figure 7.15, a Get interaction is selected), a message is \nsent by the WA to the SA (step 5), which then issues the correspond- \ning CoAP request and receives the response from the smart object \n(step 6). The response is then processed and the results are pushed to \nthe WA (step 7) and then presented to the user (View 4a). In case of \nresource observation (View 3b), when the smart object sends updates \nto the SA, the SA pushes this information to the WA, which presents \na noti\ufb01cation (View 4b). A dedicated view is also available to the user \nto allow them to stop observing resources (View 5). \n\n7.4.3.1 \nFuture Vision: towards the Tactile Internet \nThe strong evolutionary trend in several ICT \ufb01elds, from electronics \nto telecommunications and computing, has brought signi\ufb01cant inno- \nvations in the way people use and interface with the environment. On \none hand, mobile and wearable computing have allowed people to be \nconnected anywhere and at anytime and to consume services while on \nthe go. On the other hand, cheap embedded systems and low-power \noperating systems and communication protocols have paved the way \nto the development of the IoT. Although these \ufb01elds have evolved \nindependently, they are converging and complement one another \nmore and more, thanks to the \ufb02exibility and inherent capabilities of \nsmartphones. The combination of and integration between the IoT \nand mobile/wearable devices is allowing industry and researchers to \nenvision a path towards a true Internet of Anything [235], capable of \nconnecting everyone and everything. \nImprovements in communication technologies, in terms of ever- \nincreasing speed, reliability, and security, are paving the road to \nthe delivery of groundbreaking applications to the general public. \nWhile the IoT is being designed around low-power devices with \nlimited capabilities, the enhancements that future 5G networks are \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n349 \n\ngoing to bring about will foster the development of services and \napplications that will no longer su\ufb00er from the strong limitations of \nearlier technologies, such as 4K video streaming or real-time remote \ncontrol. Combined with fog computing techniques [205], aiming at \nminimizing latency and enabling real-time applications by moving \nsome processing load to the edge of local networks, the idea of \nend-to-end communication in times of the order of milliseconds is \ngoing to become a reality. These technologies will lead to the ability to \nperform haptic (meaning touch-based) interactions with connected \nthings, either in the proximity or at a distance, thus bringing about the \nrise of the \u201cTactile Internet\u201d [236] and its application to healthcare, \neducation, robotics, and many others \ufb01elds. Wearable devices will \nplay a signi\ufb01cant role in this mission and are already set to be the \ndrivers of many kinds of haptic interactions with things. \nThanks to the IoT, users will no longer need to be in charge of mon- \nitoring and controlling things when this is not needed. However, they \nwill still be able to interact with their surroundings when they want to \ndo so. Natural interaction patterns between users and smart objects \nthrough wearable devices will be a key enabler to reach this goal: these \nmodels will guide and teach users by increasing their awareness with- \nout requiring them to learn new paradigms. \n\n7.5 \nE\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web \nof Things \n\nBy connecting billions of \u201csmart objects\u201d, the IoT is set to have a dra- \nmatic impact on how people interact with the surrounding environ- \nment, whether at home or in public places. With forecasts of such a \ngigantic number of deployed smart objects, much attention is being \ngiven to the societal and economic impacts of the IoT. \nTechnologies such as Apple\u2019s HomeKit 24 or the new Google \nBrillo/Weave duo, 25 are just two examples of how big players have \napproached the IoT; that is, by trying to a\ufb03rm proprietary solutions \nas standards, just as in the early days of the Internet. In order to \ntame the extreme diversity of smart objects, in terms of processing \ncapabilities, communication technologies, operating systems, and \n\n24 https://developer.apple.com/homekit/ . \n25 https://developers.google.com/brillo/ . \n\n350 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nimplemented functions, in recent years much e\ufb00ort has been dedi- \ncated to de\ufb01ning standard mechanisms and protocols that will actually \nenable things to be connected to each other and with the Internet. \nMoreover, the experience gained in the design of the traditional \nInternet is a valuable asset that can be exploited in order to avoid \nmaking the same errors and seeing the same issues as encountered \nover the last 25 years of the Internet. \nFrom a business standpoint, the time is ripe for IoT products to reach \nthe market. However, there is still much e\ufb00ort required to make the IoT \nsimple to use, practical, and e\ufb00ective, in order to broaden the range of \nusers and to show the real capabilities of what the IoT can do, instead \nof putting on the market products that are attractive only to special- \nists and experts. The expectations and concerns of users about new \nproducts are primarily related to the possibility to interact with smart \ndevices in a seamless and e\ufb00ective way and to do so securely. While \ntasks that can be achieved with a certain product or application are \nbusiness matters that go beyond the domain of pure technology, there \nare requirements that must be met to ensure that the IoT will not head \ninto a dead end. \nThe Web of Things (WoT) paradigm pushes interoperability further, \nby letting applications interact using standard and uniform interfaces, \nwith the same simplicity experienced on the web. Besides RESTful- \nness, the WoT will also have additional requirements, such as support \nfor di\ufb00erent communication paradigms including one-to-many com- \nmunication, and support for publish-subscribe patterns [237]. Thanks \nto these standardization e\ufb00orts, we can consider interoperability more \nas a business issue rather than a technological one. \nIn the future, users (and things) will be dealing with a the large \nnumber of smart devices deployed either in private or public spaces. \nEven if interoperability is ensured, it is not feasible to manually \ncon\ufb01gure each and every device in order to discover which objects are \nnearby and which functions they provide. In order to let applications \nbe ready to operate with devices with minimal (or no) con\ufb01guration, \nmechanisms for the discovery of devices, services, and resources have \nbeen proposed, as presented in Chapter 4. These functions may also \nbe implemented on speci\ufb01c network elements, such as IoT Hubs (see \nSection 6.6), which can act as communication enablers and provide \ndiscovery as a service. \nApplying Web technologies to the physical world, leading to the \n\u201cPhysical Web\u201d[231], will enable simple interactions with and among \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n351 \n\nthings. In this context, the concerns of users about new products are \nprimarily related to secure access; that is, only parties with proper \nauthorization must be able to interact with smart objects. However, \nin the rush to launch IoT products, security and authorization issues \nhave not been taken into proper consideration from a standardization \nand long-term perspective. Secure and authorized access to smart \nobjects has typically been provided through product-related cloud \nplatforms, which mediate between a smartphone app and the smart \nobject. Notwithstanding this, standard and e\ufb00ective mechanisms for \nmanaging authorized access to things are required to really make \nusing and sharing things with others simple and safe. In this section, \nwe present a standards-based authorization framework for WoT \napplications, which allows users to e\ufb00ectively de\ufb01ne \ufb01ne-grained \npolicies to access shared resources. The proposed framework relies \non the IoT-OAS architecture (Section 5.3.2), which implements a \ndelegation strategy for authorization. The use of IoT-OAS makes it \nfeasible to let smart objects implement e\ufb00ective access policies to \nhosted resources and to minimize the amount of processing load. \nThere are also other bene\ufb01ts, such as \n\n\u2022 remote management of access policies without direct intervention \non smart objects; \n\u2022 extension of smart object battery lifetimes; \n\u2022 scalability, in terms of the number of external clients that can access \nresources. \n\nIoT-OAS is suitably extended by integrating a simple set of messages \nthat can be used to manage ownership and shared access to resources, \nwith minimal operation required by the actors involved. An imple- \nmentation of the complete framework is presented here in order to \nshow the simplicity of the proposed approach and to highlight all the \nbene\ufb01ts that it can introduce. \nIn the WoT. besides user authentication, things will need to \nauthenticate in order to communicate securely. Password-based \nauthentication, which works \ufb01ne with humans, does not apply well to \nthings: embedding con\ufb01dential information in (possibly unattended \nand vulnerable) objects might not be the safest option. Moreover, for \nconstrained devices, traditional encryption algorithms and security \nprotocols used on the Internet, such as TLS, might not be feasible. \nLightweight cryptographic algorithms, such as PRESENT, TEA, and \nSEA, with shorter keys, have been proposed to provide security for \n\n352 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nthese application contexts. At the same time, lightweight secure \ntransports, such as DTLS (used in conjunction with CoAP, an \narrangement denoted as CoAPs), might be preferred over their \nconnection-oriented equivalents. \nAuthentication alone is not enough to provide su\ufb03cient safety and \nsecurity in the IoT, where the cyber world and physical world will \nmerge. Authorization issues must be taken into account to ensure \nthat access to sensing and actuating devices, both in private and \npublic spaces, occurs only by authorized parties. The Delegated CoAP \nAuthentication and Authorization Framework (DCAF) [193], pro- \nposed by the IETF Authentication and Authorization for Constrained \nEnvironments (ACE) Working Group, de\ufb01nes a protocol to delegate \nthe establishment of a DTLS channel between resource-constrained \nnodes and external clients. DCAF targets scenarios where CoAP \nrequires a secure transport. Even though the delegation approach \nis expedient to reduce the processing load and requirements on \nconstrained nodes, DCAF does not take into account authorization \naspects that are needed when third-parties access resources. \nA reference approach to third-party access to resources is OAuth \n[173, 175]. OAuth has been used e\ufb00ectively for online social networks \nthat provide access through RESTful APIs. However, OAuth is based \non HTTP, which cannot always be used as a communication protocol \nwith smart objects. \nWhen referring to authorization in the WoT, there are complex \nproblems that need to be solved. Object owners might want to \nrestrict access to their resources, while still being able to grant access \nprivileges to authorized parties (e.g., a person might want to share \naccess to a home smartlock with their spouse, but not with any other \nindividual). These problems can be categorized as: \n\n\u2022 owner-to-owner authorization (when the object owner authorizes \nhimself to control an object); \n\u2022 owner-to-any authorization (when the object owner authorizes \nother parties to control an object he owns) [237]. \n\nOwner-to-owner authorization is addressed by OAuth 2.0 [175]. How- \never, while and the user-managed access pro\ufb01le [238] of OAuth 2.0 \naddresses owner-to-any authorization in the web, it does not suit con- \nstrained environments. Owner-to-any authorization in the WoT will \nbe an important and common scenario and needs to be addressed \ne\ufb00ectively. \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n353 \n\n7.5.1 \nAuthorization Framework Architecture \n\nThe proposed framework builds on and completes the IoT-OAS \narchitecture, introducing mechanisms for the issuing of access tokens \nthat can be used to access resources in IoT applications. The IoT-OAS \narchitecture introduces a delegation approach to authorization that \ncan be used e\ufb00ectively to manage and enforce \ufb01ne-grained access \npolices for any kind of resource, either in the Web for in the WoT. \nIoT-OAS provides a verify() function that can be invoked by smart \nobjects or intermediate network elements, such as proxies, called \nservice providers, that need to check incoming requests from service \nconsumers before serving them, as shown in Figure 7.16. The presence \nof IoT-OAS is transparent to requesting parties, which can therefore \noperate without any change required in their implementation. \n\n7.5.1.1 \nSystem Operations \nThe system comprises four di\ufb00erent actors: \n\n\u2022 SO: the smart object, characterized by an identi\ufb01er (UUID), which \nhosts some resources; \n\u2022 u 1 : the owner of SO; \n\u2022 IoT-OAS: the delegation authorization service; \n\u2022 u 2 : a user, who does not own SO, but is going to control it. \n\nUsers can log on to IoT-OAS using any suitable authentication mech- \nanism it accepts, such as OpenID, Facebook login, or Google. Upon \nlogin, users are assigned an access token to be used for any interaction \nwith IoT-OAS. We assume that u 1 and u 2 already have accounts on \nIoT-OAS. Alternatively, accounts can be created on the \ufb02y by linking \nto Google or Facebook accounts. \n\nService \nProvider \nIoT-OAS \n\nPermission \nStore \nService \nConsumer \n\nresponse \n\nverify(request) \n\nverification response \n\n1 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nrequest \n(including access \ntoken) \n\nFigure 7.16 Veri\ufb01cation of access grant with IoT-OAS. \n\n354 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nTable 7.11 Authorization framework message speci\ufb01cation. \n\nAPI \nInput parameters \nDescription \n\nregister \nDevice UUID \nAdd a new device to \n\nthe list of owned devices \n\nrequest \nDevice UUID \nRequest to gain permission \n\nSet of permissions \nto control someone else\u2019s object \n\ngrant \nUser \nShare an object with another user \n\nDevice UUID \n\nSet of permissions \n\nThe framework extends IoT-OAS by providing a set of messages \nthat users can exploit to interact with IoT-OAS in order to manage \nand request access grants to smart objects. All API calls are autho- \nrized by IoT-OAS with OAuth, using the access tokens received upon \nlogin. The main methods in the framework on IoT-OAS are detailed \nin Table 7.11. \nIn order to give the \ufb01nest granularity in expressing the access privi- \nleges granted, a permission is de\ufb01ned by the tuple \u27e8 res , act , exp \u27e9 , where \nres is the URI of the resource, act is the REST method to act on the \nresource, and exp is the expiration time of the grant. The framework \ntakes into account the following three operational cases: \n\n\u2022 owner-to-owner authorization; \n\u2022 reactive owner-to-any authorization: u 2 asks permission to u 1 to \naccess an object owned by u 1 ; \n\u2022 proactive owner-to-any authorization: u 1 grants permission to u 2 to \naccess an object he owns. \n\nThe use of the API to interact with IoT-OAS allows for de\ufb01nition of a \nsimple protocol to implement the three operational cases easily. \n\nOwner-to-owner Authorization \nThe owner of an object (e.g., a someone buying an appliance for the \nhome or a system administrator for a company), denoted as u 1 , needs \nto authorize himself to gain control of the object. We assume that u 1 \nhas already logged on to IoT-OAS. The login procedure results in the \nissuing of an access token that u 1 will include in all requests to be \nidenti\ufb01ed. The message \ufb02ow for this case is shown in Figure 7.17a. \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n355 \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n1 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n1 \nDiscover \n\nRequest Access \n\nForward Request to Owner \n\nGrant Permissions \n\nDeliver/Retrieve Grant \n\nInteract with SO through IoT-OAS \n\nGrant Permissions \n\nDeliver Grant \n\nInteract with SO through IoT-OAS \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n6 \n\n5 \n2 \n3 \n\n4 \n\n1 \nu2 \nu1 \n\nu1 \nu2 \n\nuuid \n\nRead uuid \n\nuuid \n\nuuid \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nRegister uuid \n\nDeliver \u201cAll-Access\u201d Grant \n\nInteract with SO through loT-OAS \n\n4 \n\nu1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nFigure 7.17 Speci\ufb01cation of message \ufb02ows for authorization use cases: (a) access \nto resources for smart object owner; (b) reactive sharing of smart objects; \n(c) proactive sharing of smart objects. \n\n356 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\nUse u 1 can read the UUID of the smart object in some way, such \nas by scanning a QR code. u 1 sends a register ( IUUID ) request to \nIoT-OAS. Upon verifying the message, IoT-OAS binds the device \n(and, subsequently, any resource it hosts) to its owner and, at the same \ntime, invalidates any further registration request for the same UUID. \nIn addition, IoT-OAS adds \u201call-access\u201d permissions to u 1 \u2019s access \ntoken. u 1 is now authorized to perform any operation on the smart \nobject. All requests targeting the smart object must include the access \ntoken, which will be used to validate the request to IoT-OAS\u2019s verify() \nmethod. \n\nReactive Owner-to-any Authorization \nSuppose a user u 2 discovers that a smart object owned by u 1 is in his \nproximity and wishes to use it. u 2 must be granted a set of permissions \nto access the smart object\u2019s resources. We assume that u 1 and u 2 \nhave already logged on to IoT-OAS. The message \ufb02ow for this case \nis shown in Figure 7.17b. Let P be the set of permissions that u 2 \nrequires to access the smart object. To receive the grant, u 2 sends a \nrequest ( UUID , P ) message to IoT-OAS, which forwards the message \nto the owner of the smart object, u 1 . u 1 receives the message and \ngrants a set of permissions P g , which may di\ufb00er from P . u 1 sends \na grant ( u 2 , UUID , P g ) message to IoT-OAS, which adds the set of \npermission to u 2 \u2019s access token and noti\ufb01es u 2 of the result of the \noperation that he initiated. By including his token in all requests, \nveri\ufb01ed by IoT-OAS, u 2 will be able to access the smart object\u2019s \nresources. \n\nProactive Owner-to-any Authorization \nSuppose u 1 wants to share the smart object with u 2 , without u 2 \nexplicitly soliciting permission. We assume that u 1 and u 2 have \nalready logged on to IoT-OAS. The message \ufb02ow for this case is \nshown in Figure 7.17c and is a simple subset of the operations that \noccur with the reactive case. u 1 sends a grant ( u 2 , UUID , P ) message \nto IoT-OAS, which adds the set of permissions to u 2 \u2019s access token. \nAt this point, depending on the speci\ufb01c application implementation \nand/or user settings, there are two ways u 2 can receive the grant: \n\n\u2022 using a suitable push noti\ufb01cation service, IoT-OAS noti\ufb01es u 2 ; \n\u2022 as in the reactive case, after sending a request ( UUID ) message, u 2 \nwill be noti\ufb01ed immediately. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p367_i0.png)\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n357 \n\n7.5.2 \nImplementation and Validation \n\nFollowing the de\ufb01nition of the authorization framework, a complete \nimplementation of the proposed architecture has been realized to \nvalidate the approach with real smart objects and personal devices. \nCommunication occurs using CoAP/CoAPs, based on the Cal- \nifornium library [94] and its DTLS 1.2 module Scandium. 26 An \nAndroid application as implemented to support the user operations \nde\ufb01ned by the authorization \ufb02ow. At startup, the user can authenticate \nthrough Facebook or Google + , as shown in Figure 7.18a. After the \nuser has logged in, they can view the list of owned and shared devices \nand the associated permissions, as shown in Figure 7.18b. By clicking \non the \ufb02oating \u201cadd\u201d button, the user can register a device they own \nand that they want to manage, by scanning the QR code associated \nwith it. Figure 7.18c shows the device\u2019s management view, which \nallows the user to interact with available resources and manage usage \npermissions with other identi\ufb01ed consumers. \nThe application has been integrated with and tested in our com- \npany\u2019s IoT laboratory, enabling us to consider di\ufb00erent scenarios \nwith multiple active users. Through the application, o\ufb03ce employees \ncan, at the same time, interact with available sensors owned by the \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n\nFigure 7.18 Main sections of the Android application: (a) platform authentication \nwith Facebook and Google + ; (b) list of owned and shared devices; (c) detail view \nof a speci\ufb01c device with related permissions. \n\n26 https://github.com/eclipse/californium.scandium . \n\n358 \n7 The IoT in Practice \n\ncompany system administrator (e.g., temperature, light, and humidity) \nand personal devices on their desk, represented by Philips Hue 27 light \nbulbs. The meeting room was identi\ufb01ed as a common and shared area \nwhere, according to appointment schedules, users can dynamically \nreceive access grants from the Sys-admin in order to interact with \nthe room\u2019s equipment \u2013 items such as smart plugs and wireless \nlighting \u2013 during the meetings. \nAs the IoT and its applications are expected to progressively become \nan integral part of our lives, security issues must be addressed in \norder to cope with the concerns that might prevent the spread of IoT \nproducts. In general, people will interact with smart objects that they \nown and with others that they do not own but that can be shared with \nthem. Authorization mechanisms must therefore be introduced in \norder to take into account the possibility of users wanting to interact \nwith objects that they do not own. In this section, we have presented \na standards-based authorization framework for WoT applications, \nto e\ufb00ectively enforce \ufb01ne-grained policies to access and share IoT \nresources. The proposed framework allows for a simple and seamless \nmanagement of access permissions to smart objects. Operation \n\ufb02ows, relying on the IoT-OAS architecture, have been de\ufb01ned for \nowner-to-owner and owner-to-any authorization grants. Moreover, a \ncomplete implementation of the authorization framework has been \nrealized in order to validate compliance with functional requirements \nand ease of use. \n\n27 http://www.developers.meethue.com/ . \n\n359 \n\nReferences \n\n1 Leiner, B.M., Cerf, V.G., Clark, D.D., Kahn, R.E., Kleinrock, L., \nLynch, D.C., Postel, J., Roberts, L.G., and Wol\ufb00, S.
