For example, on Arduino Y\u00fan nodes, a Javascript application initializes a CoAP server on an instance of node.js. Intel Galileo boards and Raspberry Pi systems can support di\ufb00erent languages, ranging from Python to Java. The WoTT testbed, shown in Figure 7.12, is heterogeneous by design, in order to enable smart objects to communicate seamlessly with each other and to enable communications between the WoTT and external Internet elements (e.g., the cloud, Internet hosts, or con- sumers). Internet protocol (in particular, IPv6 or IPv6+6LoWPAN) is universally considered a key communication enabler for the future IoT. For this reason, the WoTT adopts IP as a common network substrate, thus allowing for simple integration with the existing Inter- net world. Figure 7.12 shows the IP-based protocol stack supported by the WoTT. It is worth noting that all nodes in the WoTT use standard protocols at all layers of the protocol stack. As can be seen, several physical (PHY) and MAC protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.3) as well as application layer protocols can be used. The architecture also introduces an innovative network element, called the IoT Hub, which operates at di\ufb00erent layers of the protocol stack in order to further enhance the interoperability among communicating devices, by integrating several networks into a single IP-based substrate and, at the same time, by implementing important functions at the application layer. Due to their greater capabilities, in \n\n332 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nterms of computational power and networking, SBC nodes can be used e\ufb00ectively to implement all the functions of an IoT Hub. The Wi-Fi networking infrastructure is based on Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX)14 and access points, which have already been installed in the WoTT buildings and can be used to track devices (for indoor localization purposes). In particular, the CMX platform provides mobility services REST APIs, which allow developers to enable service customization with location information in mobile applications, such as location-aware equipment tracking, guest access, and device-based services. This feature is currently used to build user-location-aware IoT applications, which can \u201ctrack and follow\u201d the user throughout the the WoTT building, enabling speci\ufb01c and augmented interactions with the surrounding environment. Focusing on the application layer, the WoTT currently supports CoAP, MQTT, and HTTP. CoAP is a binary and lightweight web transfer protocol built on top of UDP and follows a request/response paradigm [7]. CoAP has been explicitly designed to work with devices operating in low-power and lossy networks. MQTT is also a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol suitable for constrained smart objects, such as sensors or actuators, and runs on top of TCP. Finally, HTTP is mainly used for communication between the WoTT and external Internet actors or consumers, such as cloud storage services or IoT-unaware clients. We note that, among the WoTT components, the IoT Hub is the key IoT enabler, as it manages the di\ufb00erent access technologies and supports full IP connectivity among all objects. By implementing various functionalities at the application layer, all protocols listed in Figure 7.12 can coexist in the same environment. We also note that the software for smart objects has been developed with di\ufb00erent programming languages. This underlines once more that, thanks to the features provided at the application layer, develop- ers can create new IoT applications easily and without any constraint except for compliance with IoT standards. \n\n7.3.2 Enabling Interactions with Smart Objects through the IoT Hub \n\nThe WoTT does not simply enable communications between the IoT actors; it represents a \u201cuniform\u201d super-entity, able to provide enhanced \n\n14 Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/ solutions/enterprise-networks/connected-mobile-experiences/ index.html. \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture 333 \n\nfunctionalities that go beyond the mere union of the features provided by its components. As shown in Figure 7.12, in order to achieve this holistic vision, the WoTT introduces a new and innovative network element, called an IoT Hub (as presented in Section 6.6), which acts as a gateway that can bridge and merge several networks, using various communication technologies, into a single IP network. The IoT Hub also implements several functions at the application layer: it manages the services and resources available in the overall infrastructure, thus playing a key role at this layer too. The use of an IoT Hub is expedient for several reasons. The extreme heterogeneity of IoT devices requires mechanisms for their management and the seam- less interaction of humans and smart objects. Moreover, focusing on data collection, due to their limited capabilities smart objects may not be able to handle large numbers of concurrent requests, thus making it preferable to limit direct access to them. In other cases, extremely lim- ited devices might act as clients to implement data collection behavior. E\ufb00orts have been made to standardize the design of IoT Hubs. A relevant example is HyperCat [232], which introduces standard speci\ufb01cations to allow servers to expose JSON-based hypermedia cat- alogues as collections of URLs. Thus, IoT clients are able to discover, using REST methods, data available on servers in HTTPS and JSON format. Unlike the IoT Hub of the WoTT, HyperCat works at a higher level of abstraction, as it is intended to allow reasoning and service composition based on IoT concepts, and does not take into account direct interactions with constrained devices, where speci\ufb01c protocols (e.g., CoAP) should be adopted to minimize energy and memory consumption. From a networking standpoint, the IoT Hub is a fog node [205], placed at the edge of multiple physical networks with the goal of cre- ating an IP-based IoT network. The IoT Hub plays a fundamental role by implementing the following functions at the link and application layers of the protocol stack: \n\n\u2022 Border router: the IoT Hub bridges one or more networks (e.g., sev- eral IEEE 802.15.4 networks). \u2022 Service and resource discovery: the IoT Hub is able to discover the smart objects available in the network and their hosted resources. \u2022 Resource directory (RD): the IoT Hub complies with the relevant speci\ufb01cations [14], and maintains a list of all resources available in the bridged networks creating a centralized entry point for applica- tions that need to perform resource lookup. \n\n334 7 The IoT in Practice \n\n\u2022 Origin server (OS): the IoT Hub provides a CoAP server that hosts the smart object\u2019s resources. \u2022 CoAP-to-CoAP (C2C) proxy: the IoT Hub provides proxying capabilities for CoAP requests from external clients targeting constrained nodes. \u2022 HTTP-to-CoAP (H2C) proxy: the IoT Hub provides HTTP-to-CoAP cross-proxying (i.e., protocol translation) in order to allow HTTP clients to access to CoAP resources. \u2022 Cache: the IoT Hub keeps a cache with a representation of most recently accessed resources in order to act as a smart object dele- gate, minimizing latency and reducing load on constrained devices. \n\nBy adopting standard mechanisms and communication protocols, smart objects do not depend on the IoT Hub for their operation; in addition, the IoT Hub is able to mitigate the presence of non-standard components that might not interoperate with standard-compliant devices. It is important to point out that the presence of the IoT Hub is not mandatory for interaction and interoperability, but its presence extends the IoT network and increases its capabilities, by simplifying and hiding complex and important tasks such as service discovery and routing. \n\n7.3.2.1 Integration Challenges The main challenges encountered in the deployment of the WoTT are related to design: the de\ufb01nition of the di\ufb00erent elements and their functionalities, the representation of the di\ufb00erent resources and their relationships through suitable hypermedia, and maintenance of com- patibility with standards. The e\ufb00orts devoted to the design of the WoTT, together with the IoT Hub and the use of standards, has simpli\ufb01ed the deployment process, making the integration of all di\ufb00erent elements straightfor- ward, notwithstanding their heterogeneity. In particular, the WoTT hides critical implementation issues encountered at lower layers. For example, in a constrained network (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4) the resource advertisement feature is critical, requiring strict assumptions about energy and memory consumption on each constrained device. In Section 4.4, the advertisement of nodes belonging to the network was analyzed, and we derived a multicast solution that allows a reduction in energy consumption. The end users (application-oriented) of the WoTT are not concerned with these implementation details. \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture 335 \n\nAnother implementation challenge that is hidden from end users was the creation of IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and the con\ufb01guration of networks elements (e.g., routers and access points), in order to create a unique IP-addressable network. The \ufb01rmware provided with common network elements typically does not allow these unusual con\ufb01gura- tions. To overcome this limitation, the WoTT network components have been \ufb02ashed with more customizable and advanced \ufb01rmware, such as Tomato.15 \n\n7.3.3 Testbed Access and Security \n\nWith its goal of becoming a publicly available platform, the WoTT complies with security policies and mechanisms, adopting strong defense measures in order to counteract security threats. These threats may come from external environments, as well as from mali- cious internal IoT entities. The experience gained from the years of development of the web provides useful security technologies and mechanisms that can be taken as a reference and applied to enhance the protection and reliability of IoT environments. With access by external clients, the WoTT is able to manage and authenticate request issuers, de\ufb01ning at the same time processing poli- cies and rules. To comply with these speci\ufb01cations, the WoTT allows external connections through VPN and SSH tunnels, using credentials issued by WoTT administrators. Several security mechanisms for smart object interaction are implemented within the testbed. TLS (in conjunction with HTTP) and DTLS (the secure transport for CoAP) are implemented on a set of devices that host resources that need to be accessed through secured application protocols. The IoT Hub implements both security protocols in order to provide secure resource access through proxying. Of course, end-to-end security through proxying cannot be ensured, as no TLS-to-DTLS mapping is de\ufb01ned. \n\n7.3.3.1 The Role of Authorization While DTLS and TLS are implemented to enforce con\ufb01dentiality and authenticity of communication between endpoints, real-world IoT systems must be able to manage multiple users accessing the resources deployed in a smart environment. This is when authorization comes \n\n15 Tomato \ufb01rmware: http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p346_i0.png)\n336 7 The IoT in Practice \n\ninto the picture: mechanisms must be de\ufb01ned in order to ensure that only authorized parties can interact with objects. For example, in a multi-occupant building hosting the WoTT, o\ufb03ces should be able to be unlocked only by those who have been granted access and not just to anyone who has discovered a \u201csmart lock\u201d. Even though authorization is obviously a critical issue, research has not yet focused on de\ufb01ning mechanisms to grant authorization and manage access policies in IoT scenarios. In order to take this issue into account, the WoTT implements an authorization architecture based on the OAuth protocol, called IoT-OAS (see Section 5.3.2). This architecture implements a lightweight delegation approach to authorization. \n\n7.3.4 Exploiting the Testbed: WoT Applications for Mobile and Wearable Devices \n\nThanks to the high-level of abstraction and full interoperability of the WoTT, web, mobile, and wearable WoT applications have been devel- oped using it (Figure 7.13). Due to the need to \ufb01ll the gap between the mobile/wearable world and the IoT, it is important to de\ufb01ne innovative interaction patterns, through which developers might build, deploy, and connect their applications so that these can be used in a simple way by end users. To validate the bene\ufb01ts of the WoTT and demon- strate the ease of integration of a newly deployed application with the testbed, wearable-enabled and mobile-oriented applications have been \n\n\nWeb \n\nWearable \n\nMobile \n\nFigure 7.13 Web, mobile, and wearable REST-based testbed applications. \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture 337 \n\ndeveloped with the goal to start interacting with \u201cthings\u201d in a natural way, similar to what a person experiences everyday on the web. Thanks to their portability, wearable and mobile devices are attrac- tive ways to track people\u2019s actions in the real world. Indoor localization features have been developed in the WoTT, using triangulation tech- niques implemented through the CMX access points. The availability of localization APIs in the Cisco CMX system allows applications to be built that take into account the location and movement of users throughout a building. This is an extremely interesting feature, which can pave the way for development of applications that can actually follow the user and even anticipate their movements in the building. Together with access-point-based localization, the use of on-board inertial measurement units can further improve the tracking capability. Mobile devices play an important role in our architecture. Besides interacting with the deployed smart objects, they can also act as smart objects, providing data generated by their onboard sensors. Mobile devices can thus be considered as WoTT nodes, making the WoTT a highly dynamic and evolving system. By providing a uniform and application-oriented platform, the WoTT can be used e\ufb00ectively by developers to create and test real- world IoT applications easily and in short time, thus making the WoTT more attractive than other currently available platforms. This is made possible by the ready-to-use capabilities and the direct/active interactions that a deployed application may have with the resources availables into the WoTT. From an operational point of view, devel- opers only have to run their applications involving testbed resources, without any additional need to virtualize environment services, and becoming part of a WoT scenario, in which consumers are not only \u201creaders\u201d, but active participants. Based on the capabilities provided by the WoTT, we have developed a mobile and wearable application (Figure 7.13), which recreates the basic steps envisioned for a WoT application that can really be used by anyone. These applications have been tested on the Android Wear plat- form using LG G watches and Android 5.0.1 smartphones. In the near future, as more and more smart objects are deployed, vendor-provided apps will no longer be the typical means to interact with things: a more standard approach will be needed in order to do so e\ufb00ectively. The developed application performs the following steps. The mobile device \ufb01rst discovers smart objects in its proximity, proactively \n\n338 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nand reactively, by means of standard service discovery and resource directory mechanisms, and then forwards the collected information to its connected wearable device interface. Through wearable interfaces, a user can see and browse a list of all the resources that have been discovered and select one to interact with. Interactions are performed according to the function set speci\ufb01ed by the selected smart object (e.g., a light bulb might provide an on/o\ufb00switch, while a temperature sensor might just provide a way to read its value). Resources and interactions are revealed gradually, according to the REST paradigm, so that the application can adapt itself dynamically. We note that WoTT resources can be deployed on di\ufb00erent plat- forms (e.g., di\ufb00erent smart objects) and using heterogeneous proto- cols. However, this is completely transparent to a developer, who can access all these resources, only constrained by the need to use stan- dard protocols. This possibility is granted by the IoT Hub\u2019s abstraction ability and is not a feature of other existing testbeds (e.g., SmartSan- tander). A user can interact with smart objects through one of the following approaches: \n\n\u2022 Polling allows the user to retrieve the value associated with the queried resource, by performing a CoAP GET request. \u2022 Observing can be used to receive asynchronous updates when the value of the speci\ufb01ed resource changes, adopting an e\ufb03cient mech- anism and avoiding the need for periodic data polling. \u2022 Acting is used to set the value of a speci\ufb01ed resource, depending on the function set provided by the resource. \n\nThe observing approach, which was not de\ufb01ned in HTTP, is a lightweight CoAP-oriented interaction mechanism [9]. Resource observing is achieved by ussuing a CoAP GET request containing an Observe option. This option instructs the target smart object to add a new subscriber, which will receive, in push mode, subsequent resource updates. Subscribers also have the ability to stop observing a resource at any time, by unsubscribing from updates. \n\n7.3.5 Open Challenges and Future Vision \n\nThe use of standard protocols, the use of well-known web-based approaches, and the widespread di\ufb00usion of hardware platforms are \n\n7.3 Vision and Architecture 339 \n\nchanging and opening the IoT world to new developers, businesses, and users. Against this dynamic and evolving background, the avail- ability of real and accessible resource-oriented testbeds that allow active and direct interaction with low-level nodes and services is one of the key enablers for the future adoption of the IoT by a broad audience, and even for the \ufb01nal transition from the IoT to the WoT. The ongoing WoTT experience provides a concrete example of new architectural and networking solutions that address important open issues and challenges for the IoT. The experience gained in designing and implementing our testbed has con\ufb01rmed that there is a concrete need for open evaluation platforms aimed at integrating and experimenting with innovative solutions, in order to develop appli- cations that can really bridge today\u2019s gap between users and things. The heterogeneity (in terms of hardware and software) of our testbed, testi\ufb01es to how the proper use of standard protocols (e.g., HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT) and interaction paradigms and approaches (such as REST and service/resource discovery), are fundamental to creating transparent and dynamic interactions among multiple smart objects and personal user devices, such as smartphones and wearables. Moreover, this heterogeneity can be extended, with limited e\ufb00ort, by improving the IoT Hub features (e.g., adding support for Bluetooth devices). This would open up the WoTT to a new emerging category of IoT-enabled devices, namely Bluetooth Low Energy, thus allowing its integration with other service discovery mechanisms, such as UriBeacon.16 \n\nNevertheless, important open issues still need to be tackled to bring the IoT into our daily life. Security, interoperability, data pro- cessing, human interaction, and easy development and deployment are the keywords that will characterize academic and industrial R&D activities over the next few years. IoT-application-oriented testbeds represent the perfect experimental playgrounds to boost and support development of IoT applications, creating a common space that developers, hardware manufacturers, and companies can exploit in order to reach the goal of making the IoT accessible and easy to use for everyone, just as the Internet is right now. \n\n16 The UriBeacon Open Standard, (Apr 2015) http://uribeacon.org. \n\n340 7 The IoT in Practice \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT: Interaction Patterns with Smart Objects in RESTful Environments \n\nOver the next few years, the IoT is expected to become a reality, merg- ing the social world, the physical world, and the cyber world to enable new applications and forms of interactions between humans and con- nected smart sensing/actuating devices. As billions of smart objects will be deployed in the environment, users should be able to discover and interact with objects in their proximity in a seamless and transpar- ent way. While smartphones have become an extremely popular com- puting device, the advent of smart wearable devices, such as Google Glass and the Apple Watch, has provided even more e\ufb00ective means to bridge the gap between humans and smart objects. In this section, we analyze the characteristics of wearable applications for IoT scenar- ios and describe the interaction patterns that should occur between wearable/mobile devices and smart objects. \n\n7.4.1 Shaping the Internet of Things in a Mobile-Centric World \n\nIn recent decades, the Internet has allowed people to access and consume services on a global scale, using traditional hosts and always- connected mobile devices, such as their smartphones, typically using the World Wide Web. By connecting objects and devices, the IoT will fully exploit the potential of networking and enable innovative services to be o\ufb00ered in a wide range of scenarios, such as home and building automation, smart cities, and healthcare, integrating new paradigms for human-to-machine (H2M) and machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. Many IoT applications will allow people to inter- act with smart environments, allowing them to obtain information and to change the environment according to their needs and prefer- ences, sometimes without actually being in the loop. IoT applications will take advantage of the wide di\ufb00usion and pervasive deployment of smart objects: tiny devices equipped with a microcontroller, a communication interface (wired or wireless), a power supply, and a set of sensors and/or actuators to be used to interface with the surrounding environment. \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT 341 \n\nSeveral players are developing innovative IoT-related products in a variety of \ufb01elds, which are starting to reach end-users, who are now becoming aware of the integration of physical and cyber worlds. The \u201cgold rush\u201d of the IoT-era, driven, on one hand, by developers\u2019 will to demonstrate the feasibility of interconnecting everyday devices to people and, on the other hand, by their hope to turn their custom solu- tions into standards for the general public, has created a plethora of closed vertical solutions. This is leading to a highly fragmented market: a babel of incompatible solutions, as opposite to a highly standardized and interoperable environment, which is what the Internet (of Things) should be [231]. In order to prevent the IoT reaching a dead end due to fragmentation caused by these vertical solutions, much e\ufb00ort has been expended in research projects and standardization organizations, such as IEEE, IETF, and the IPSO Alliance. The successful model for communication represented by the Web has been considered as a reference point for the IoT as well. We can now assume that the IoT will be a network of heterogeneous intercon- nected devices; this will be the infrastructure for the WoT. Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) have become the most popular computing devices in the world, topping the per-capita rate of penetration of personal computers for the \ufb01rst time in mid-2012 [233]. We are living in a mobile-centric world, characterized by symbiosis and interdependence between users and their mobile devices, to the point where one cannot work without the other. Thanks to their rich capabilities, mobile devices are handy and ready-to-use gateways to all IoT objects deployed nearby or far away: a cyber-\u201cSwiss-army knife\u201d for the IoT. This ease of access be enhanced further by the evolution of wearable computing, which has the potential to augment the ways people interact with services (e.g., through voice control, gestures, or touch) or provide information to services (e.g., heart rate monitoring, \ufb01tness applications). The smartphone is the enabler for a user who wants to control and interact with smart objects in his proximity and wearable devices. Interaction with smart objects through wearable devices will represent a quantum leap towards the full integration of the social world, the cyber world, and the physical world, and will be, in fact, a milestone for the widespread adoption of the IoT. The interac- tion between wearable devices and IoT objects should occur through well-de\ufb01ned patterns, which must take into account their nature, while providing maximum usability and the best user experience. \n\n342 7 The IoT in Practice \n\n7.4.2 Interaction Patterns with Smart Objects through Wearable Devices \n\nThe evolution of mobile and wearable computing has changed the way people use online services. They are now always connected, whether at home or on the go. In this context, there is a concrete need to \ufb01ll the gap between mobile devices and the IoT. A paradigm shift in speci\ufb01c aspects is needed to let people access and use the IoT with the same simplicity as when accessing the Internet and, possibly, to enable new and more natural forms of interactions, which will broaden the range of IoT users. \n\n7.4.2.1 Smart Object Communication Principles The idea of an IP-based IoT has been around for years and is now considered as a fact. The adoption of the IP protocol for smart object addressing and communication is the driver to full interoperability and integrability of the IoT with the existing Internet. In particular, the use of IPv6 has been foreseen as the solution to the management of billions of globally-addressable devices. A fundamental principle that has driven IoT research and the work of standardization institutions is the maximization of the reuse of standard Internet protocols and mechanisms. Due to the limitations of low-performance IoT devices, it is not always possible to use the traditional TCP/IP protocol stack. New energy-e\ufb03cient and low-overhead communication protocols and data formats, which take into account group communication, mobil- ity, and interactions among multiple devices, have been designed. The introduction of 6LoWPAN has solved the problem of bringing IP to low-power devices. Thanks to the de\ufb01nition of common standards, the IoT is ready to reach the next level: the Web of Things (WoT). The Web is by far the most popular and familiar interaction model on the Internet. The WoT is being designed around well-known concepts and practices derived from the Web, such as the REST paradigm. The REST paradigm was introduced to loosely couple client applications with the systems that they interact with and to support long-term evolution of systems and provide robustness. At the application layer, CoAP has been designated as the standard protocol for the WoT, similar to the role of HTTP for the Web. In fact, CoAP has been designed to work with HTTP, to which it maps easily for integration purposes, by inheriting from it the identi\ufb01cation of resources through URIs, the request/response communication model, \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT 343 \n\nand the semantics of its methods. However, it is not possible to fully map CoAP to HTTP for a number of reasons. In particular, CoAP is a binary UDP-based protocol, while HTTP implies connection-oriented communications. CoAP also introduces some signi\ufb01cant enhance- ments and optimizations that are relevant for low-power devices, such as support for group communication and resource observation. This latter feature allows client applications, after an initial request, to receive updates for a given resource in successive response messages, without the need to perform periodic polling. Resource observation introduces a new communication paradigm within REST. Note that REST is not the only communication pattern that is ever going to be adopted in the IoT, similarly to what happens on the traditional Internet: protocols using publish/subscribe mechanisms \ufb01t well when a single source delivers information to multiple receivers. \n\n7.4.2.2 Interaction Patterns A smartphone is required when using wearable devices: it is responsi- ble for performing all the heavy duty and complex tasks (notably pro- cessing and communication). Wearable devices are, in fact, extensions of a mobile devices, the latter acting as central hubs. In order to enable truly seamless and practical interaction with smart objects through wearable devices, it is crucial that the smartphone takes care of these tasks behind the scenes. In smart environments, wearable devices will thus play the role of true enabler of natural interactions with things, which is what people expect. As pointed out by Sergey Brin in a TED talk at the time of the launch of the Google Glass, the use of smart- phones isolates people, making them constantly and obsessively look- ing down at their devices [234]. The Google Glass (and, in general, any wearable device) should let people keep their heads up, instead, thus allowing for simpler and more natural interactions. This change is going to have an even bigger impact when users start interacting with a myriad of smart objects, rather than just texting or checking emails. Wearable devices can be classi\ufb01ed into two categories. Passive wearables do not require any direct human interaction (e.g., heart rate monitors and step counters) and are therefore tightly coupled with a mobile device hosting a custom app to control them. Active wearables (e.g., smart watches and glasses) provide information to users and can be used as sources of input, for control of the wearable itself and also the mobile device they are connected to. As a consequence, they \n\n344 7 The IoT in Practice \n\n\nList \n\nSocial World Cyber World \n\nPhysical World \n\nDetail \n\nGet \n\nObserve \n\nUpdate \n\nFigure 7.14 Interaction patterns between wearable devices and smart objects. \n\ncan extend their reach to other devices, which can be located in their proximity or at a distance. For our purposes, we focus exclusively on active wearables, as they should be the drivers of interactions with smart objects. Figure 7.14 shows the interaction patterns that we envision between humans, using wearable devices, and smart objects that may be around them. As described above, smartphones and wearable devices are the bridge between the social world (users), the cyber world (networked hosts), and the physical world (connected smart objects). Typically, there are some questions that users might ask when trying to interact with a smart environment: \n\n1) What objects are around me? 2) Do I have the right privileges to control or interact with it directly? 3) What is a given object? What can it do and what can I do with it? 4) How can I interact with it? \n\nIn order to answer the above questions and provide a natural sequence of interactions, we have envisioned an operational \ufb02ow, which can be summarized as follows: \n\n\u2022 The smartphone discovers the smart objects in its proxim- ity (Q1) for which the user has been granted the appropriate access privileges (Q2), by means of suitable service discovery (e.g., ZeroConf, as presented in Section 4.3, or low-power radio \n\n7.4 Wearable Computing for the IoT 345 \n\nbeacon broadcasting) and resource discovery (e.g., CoAP resource directory) mechanisms, and presents this information on the wearable device interface. \u2022 The user can select one item (using vocal input or touch) and get detailed information related to the selected resource, com- bining the information retrieved in the previous step with other descriptors that can be retrieved on the \ufb02y, such as the function set that can be used to operate the resource [55] or a custom user interface (Q3). \u2022 The user can then browse through the available forms of interac- tion with the selected resource, through specialized interfaces for the possible actions that can be performed (Q4). \u2022 The user interacts with the resources, always using the smartphone as a bridge to perform the actual communication with smart objects, adopting one of the following methods: \u2013 Get: this method allows the user to retrieve the value associ- ated with the resource, by performing a CoAP GET request (e.g., to check the status \u2013 closed or open \u2013 of a smart-lock-equipped door). \u2013 Observe: this method employs an e\ufb03cient mechanism for receiving asynchronous updates when the value of a resource changes, thus avoiding having to periodically poll for data [55]. This is achieved by performing a CoAP GET request containing an Observe option to instruct the object to send updates. An observe relation can be then torn down at any time (e.g., to monitor the temperature of a room so that a thermostat can be activated). \u2013 Update: this method is used to act upon a resource to set its the value, by performing a CoAP POST or PUT request, depending on the function set provided by the resource (e.g., to switch lights on or of). \n\nThe use of CoAP is not strictly required: the presence of cross- proxies, which might perform protocol translation, can enable the same interactions with CoAP-unaware clients that may use HTTP. \n\n7.4.3 Implementation in a Real-world IoT Testbed \n\nFollowing the interaction patterns described above, a wearable-based application for interacting with smart objects has been implemented \n\n346 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nand tested within an IoT testbed deployed inside our department, with 70 IP-addressable devices running CoAP servers that host sensing and actuating resources. The IoT testbed consists of several types of nodes, which di\ufb00er in terms of computational capabilities and radio access interfaces. The considered nodes can be grouped into two main classes: 36 constrained IoT nodes and 34 single board computer (SBC) nodes. The constrained IoT nodes are Class 1 devices, according to the ter- minology introduced in RFC 7228 [229], based on the Contiki oper- ating system and using IEEE 802.15.4 radio. Speci\ufb01cally, the following constrained IoT nodes were used: \n\n\u2022 6 TelosB17 \n\n\u2022 20 Zolertia Z118 \n\n\u2022 10 OpenMote-CC2538.19 \n\nThe SBC nodes are Class 2 devices, typically running a Linux operating system and with multiple network interfaces. Speci\ufb01cally, the follow- ing SBC nodes were used: \n\n\u2022 20 Intel Galileo20 \n\n\u2022 5 Raspberry Pi Model B21 \n\n\u2022 5 Arduino Y\u00fan22 (dual Linux/Arduino environment) \u2022 4 UDOO23 (dual Linux/Arduino environment). \n\nThe IoT testbed is purposely heterogeneous in order to simulate the expected real-world IoT conditions, characterized by an extremely high degree of diversity of smart objects. It also highlights how the use of standard communication protocols and mechanisms, combined with our envisioned operational \ufb02ow, can enforce interoperability and e\ufb00ective interactions among applications, in a real WoT fashion. The mobile/wearable application was developed on the Android Wear platform using LG G watches and Android Lollipop smartphones.

There are essentially three actors involved in the application\u2019s lifecycle: the smartphone, the wearable device, and the smart objects. Each operation, which may be initiated by any of these, involves an information exchange that a\ufb00ects them all. The smartphone is the gateway between the smart objects and wearable devices, as shown in Figure 7.14. The communication between the smartphone and the smart objects occurs using CoAP, which is based on the Californium library [94]. The smartphone application (SA) communicates with the wearable companion application (WA) using the Android Wear- able Data Layer API, which uses Bluetooth for communication. At startup (step 1), SA performs resource discovery using a combined mechanism: \n\n\u2022 using ZeroConf, it discovers CoAP servers, whose lists of resources are then retrieved by performing a GET request to the /.well- known/core URI; \u2022 a multicast GET request to the /.well-known/core URI is sent to all smart objects in the network, which return their lists of hosted resources. \n\n348 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nAfter the SA has gathered the list of all available resources, it pushes this information to the WA (step 2), which presents the list of resources to the user (View 1). The user selects a resource of interest, and is presented with a dedicated detail view of that resource (step 3), which includes resource-speci\ufb01c information, such as its human-readable name and type (View 2). According to the interface of the resource [55], the WA presents (in a 2D picker) swipeable cards that contain action buttons, which can trigger interactions with the resource, using the previously described Get, Observe, and Update schemes (Views 3a, 3b, and 3c, respectively). Upon user selection (for instance, in Figure 7.15, a Get interaction is selected), a message is sent by the WA to the SA (step 5), which then issues the correspond- ing CoAP request and receives the response from the smart object (step 6). The response is then processed and the results are pushed to the WA (step 7) and then presented to the user (View 4a). In case of resource observation (View 3b), when the smart object sends updates to the SA, the SA pushes this information to the WA, which presents a noti\ufb01cation (View 4b). A dedicated view is also available to the user to allow them to stop observing resources (View 5). \n\n7.4.3.1 Future Vision: towards the Tactile Internet The strong evolutionary trend in several ICT \ufb01elds, from electronics to telecommunications and computing, has brought signi\ufb01cant inno- vations in the way people use and interface with the environment. On one hand, mobile and wearable computing have allowed people to be connected anywhere and at anytime and to consume services while on the go. On the other hand, cheap embedded systems and low-power operating systems and communication protocols have paved the way to the development of the IoT. Although these \ufb01elds have evolved independently, they are converging and complement one another more and more, thanks to the \ufb02exibility and inherent capabilities of smartphones. The combination of and integration between the IoT and mobile/wearable devices is allowing industry and researchers to envision a path towards a true Internet of Anything [235], capable of connecting everyone and everything. Improvements in communication technologies, in terms of ever- increasing speed, reliability, and security, are paving the road to the delivery of groundbreaking applications to the general public. While the IoT is being designed around low-power devices with limited capabilities, the enhancements that future 5G networks are \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things 349 \n\ngoing to bring about will foster the development of services and applications that will no longer su\ufb00er from the strong limitations of earlier technologies, such as 4K video streaming or real-time remote control. Combined with fog computing techniques [205], aiming at minimizing latency and enabling real-time applications by moving some processing load to the edge of local networks, the idea of end-to-end communication in times of the order of milliseconds is going to become a reality. These technologies will lead to the ability to perform haptic (meaning touch-based) interactions with connected things, either in the proximity or at a distance, thus bringing about the rise of the \u201cTactile Internet\u201d [236] and its application to healthcare, education, robotics, and many others \ufb01elds. Wearable devices will play a signi\ufb01cant role in this mission and are already set to be the drivers of many kinds of haptic interactions with things. Thanks to the IoT, users will no longer need to be in charge of mon- itoring and controlling things when this is not needed. However, they will still be able to interact with their surroundings when they want to do so. Natural interaction patterns between users and smart objects through wearable devices will be a key enabler to reach this goal: these models will guide and teach users by increasing their awareness with- out requiring them to learn new paradigms. \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things \n\nBy connecting billions of \u201csmart objects\u201d, the IoT is set to have a dra- matic impact on how people interact with the surrounding environ- ment, whether at home or in public places. With forecasts of such a gigantic number of deployed smart objects, much attention is being given to the societal and economic impacts of the IoT. Technologies such as Apple\u2019s HomeKit24 or the new Google Brillo/Weave duo,25 are just two examples of how big players have approached the IoT; that is, by trying to a\ufb03rm proprietary solutions as standards, just as in the early days of the Internet. In order to tame the extreme diversity of smart objects, in terms of processing capabilities, communication technologies, operating systems, and \n\n24 https://developer.apple.com/homekit/. 25 https://developers.google.com/brillo/. \n\n350 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nimplemented functions, in recent years much e\ufb00ort has been dedi- cated to de\ufb01ning standard mechanisms and protocols that will actually enable things to be connected to each other and with the Internet. Moreover, the experience gained in the design of the traditional Internet is a valuable asset that can be exploited in order to avoid making the same errors and seeing the same issues as encountered over the last 25 years of the Internet. From a business standpoint, the time is ripe for IoT products to reach the market. However, there is still much e\ufb00ort required to make the IoT simple to use, practical, and e\ufb00ective, in order to broaden the range of users and to show the real capabilities of what the IoT can do, instead of putting on the market products that are attractive only to special- ists and experts. The expectations and concerns of users about new products are primarily related to the possibility to interact with smart devices in a seamless and e\ufb00ective way and to do so securely. While tasks that can be achieved with a certain product or application are business matters that go beyond the domain of pure technology, there are requirements that must be met to ensure that the IoT will not head into a dead end. The Web of Things (WoT) paradigm pushes interoperability further, by letting applications interact using standard and uniform interfaces, with the same simplicity experienced on the web. Besides RESTful- ness, the WoT will also have additional requirements, such as support for di\ufb00erent communication paradigms including one-to-many com- munication, and support for publish-subscribe patterns [237]. Thanks to these standardization e\ufb00orts, we can consider interoperability more as a business issue rather than a technological one. In the future, users (and things) will be dealing with a the large number of smart devices deployed either in private or public spaces. Even if interoperability is ensured, it is not feasible to manually con\ufb01gure each and every device in order to discover which objects are nearby and which functions they provide. In order to let applications be ready to operate with devices with minimal (or no) con\ufb01guration, mechanisms for the discovery of devices, services, and resources have been proposed, as presented in Chapter 4. These functions may also be implemented on speci\ufb01c network elements, such as IoT Hubs (see Section 6.6), which can act as communication enablers and provide discovery as a service. Applying Web technologies to the physical world, leading to the \u201cPhysical Web\u201d[231], will enable simple interactions with and among \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things 351 \n\nthings. In this context, the concerns of users about new products are primarily related to secure access; that is, only parties with proper authorization must be able to interact with smart objects. However, in the rush to launch IoT products, security and authorization issues have not been taken into proper consideration from a standardization and long-term perspective. Secure and authorized access to smart objects has typically been provided through product-related cloud platforms, which mediate between a smartphone app and the smart object. Notwithstanding this, standard and e\ufb00ective mechanisms for managing authorized access to things are required to really make using and sharing things with others simple and safe. In this section, we present a standards-based authorization framework for WoT applications, which allows users to e\ufb00ectively de\ufb01ne \ufb01ne-grained policies to access shared resources. The proposed framework relies on the IoT-OAS architecture (Section 5.3.2), which implements a delegation strategy for authorization. The use of IoT-OAS makes it feasible to let smart objects implement e\ufb00ective access policies to hosted resources and to minimize the amount of processing load. There are also other bene\ufb01ts, such as \n\n\u2022 remote management of access policies without direct intervention on smart objects; \u2022 extension of smart object battery lifetimes; \u2022 scalability, in terms of the number of external clients that can access resources. \n\nIoT-OAS is suitably extended by integrating a simple set of messages that can be used to manage ownership and shared access to resources, with minimal operation required by the actors involved. An imple- mentation of the complete framework is presented here in order to show the simplicity of the proposed approach and to highlight all the bene\ufb01ts that it can introduce. In the WoT. besides user authentication, things will need to authenticate in order to communicate securely. Password-based authentication, which works \ufb01ne with humans, does not apply well to things: embedding con\ufb01dential information in (possibly unattended and vulnerable) objects might not be the safest option. Moreover, for constrained devices, traditional encryption algorithms and security protocols used on the Internet, such as TLS, might not be feasible. Lightweight cryptographic algorithms, such as PRESENT, TEA, and SEA, with shorter keys, have been proposed to provide security for \n\n352 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nthese application contexts. At the same time, lightweight secure transports, such as DTLS (used in conjunction with CoAP, an arrangement denoted as CoAPs), might be preferred over their connection-oriented equivalents. Authentication alone is not enough to provide su\ufb03cient safety and security in the IoT, where the cyber world and physical world will merge. Authorization issues must be taken into account to ensure that access to sensing and actuating devices, both in private and public spaces, occurs only by authorized parties. The Delegated CoAP Authentication and Authorization Framework (DCAF) [193], pro- posed by the IETF Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) Working Group, de\ufb01nes a protocol to delegate the establishment of a DTLS channel between resource-constrained nodes and external clients. DCAF targets scenarios where CoAP requires a secure transport. Even though the delegation approach is expedient to reduce the processing load and requirements on constrained nodes, DCAF does not take into account authorization aspects that are needed when third-parties access resources. A reference approach to third-party access to resources is OAuth [173, 175]. OAuth has been used e\ufb00ectively for online social networks that provide access through RESTful APIs. However, OAuth is based on HTTP, which cannot always be used as a communication protocol with smart objects. When referring to authorization in the WoT, there are complex problems that need to be solved. Object owners might want to restrict access to their resources, while still being able to grant access privileges to authorized parties (e.g., a person might want to share access to a home smartlock with their spouse, but not with any other individual). These problems can be categorized as: \n\n\u2022 owner-to-owner authorization (when the object owner authorizes himself to control an object); \u2022 owner-to-any authorization (when the object owner authorizes other parties to control an object he owns) [237]. \n\nOwner-to-owner authorization is addressed by OAuth 2.0 [175]. How- ever, while and the user-managed access pro\ufb01le [238] of OAuth 2.0 addresses owner-to-any authorization in the web, it does not suit con- strained environments. Owner-to-any authorization in the WoT will be an important and common scenario and needs to be addressed e\ufb00ectively. \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things 353 \n\n7.5.1 Authorization Framework Architecture \n\nThe proposed framework builds on and completes the IoT-OAS architecture, introducing mechanisms for the issuing of access tokens that can be used to access resources in IoT applications. The IoT-OAS architecture introduces a delegation approach to authorization that can be used e\ufb00ectively to manage and enforce \ufb01ne-grained access polices for any kind of resource, either in the Web for in the WoT. IoT-OAS provides a verify() function that can be invoked by smart objects or intermediate network elements, such as proxies, called service providers, that need to check incoming requests from service consumers before serving them, as shown in Figure 7.16. The presence of IoT-OAS is transparent to requesting parties, which can therefore operate without any change required in their implementation. \n\n7.5.1.1 System Operations The system comprises four di\ufb00erent actors: \n\n\u2022 SO: the smart object, characterized by an identi\ufb01er (UUID), which hosts some resources; \u2022 u1: the owner of SO; \u2022 IoT-OAS: the delegation authorization service; \u2022 u2: a user, who does not own SO, but is going to control it. \n\nUsers can log on to IoT-OAS using any suitable authentication mech- anism it accepts, such as OpenID, Facebook login, or Google. Upon login, users are assigned an access token to be used for any interaction with IoT-OAS. We assume that u1 and u2 already have accounts on IoT-OAS. Alternatively, accounts can be created on the \ufb02y by linking to Google or Facebook accounts. \n\n\nService Provider IoT-OAS \n\nPermission Store Service Consumer \n\nresponse \n\nverify(request) \n\nverification response \n\n1 \n\n4 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nrequest (including access token) \n\nFigure 7.16 Veri\ufb01cation of access grant with IoT-OAS. \n\n354 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nTable 7.11 Authorization framework message speci\ufb01cation. \n\nAPI Input parameters Description \n\nregister Device UUID Add a new device to \n\nthe list of owned devices \n\nrequest Device UUID Request to gain permission \n\nSet of permissions to control someone else\u2019s object \n\ngrant User Share an object with another user \n\nDevice UUID \n\nSet of permissions \n\nThe framework extends IoT-OAS by providing a set of messages that users can exploit to interact with IoT-OAS in order to manage and request access grants to smart objects. All API calls are autho- rized by IoT-OAS with OAuth, using the access tokens received upon login. The main methods in the framework on IoT-OAS are detailed in Table 7.11. In order to give the \ufb01nest granularity in expressing the access privi- leges granted, a permission is de\ufb01ned by the tuple \u27e8res, act, exp\u27e9, where res is the URI of the resource, act is the REST method to act on the resource, and exp is the expiration time of the grant. The framework takes into account the following three operational cases: \n\n\u2022 owner-to-owner authorization; \u2022 reactive owner-to-any authorization: u2 asks permission to u1 to access an object owned by u1; \u2022 proactive owner-to-any authorization: u1 grants permission to u2 to access an object he owns. \n\nThe use of the API to interact with IoT-OAS allows for de\ufb01nition of a simple protocol to implement the three operational cases easily. \n\nOwner-to-owner Authorization The owner of an object (e.g., a someone buying an appliance for the home or a system administrator for a company), denoted as u1, needs to authorize himself to gain control of the object. We assume that u1 has already logged on to IoT-OAS. The login procedure results in the issuing of an access token that u1 will include in all requests to be identi\ufb01ed. The message \ufb02ow for this case is shown in Figure 7.17a. \n\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things 355 \n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n3 \n\n2 1 \n\n3 \n\n2 \n\n1 Discover \n\nRequest Access \n\nForward Request to Owner \n\nGrant Permissions \n\nDeliver/Retrieve Grant \n\nInteract with SO through IoT-OAS \n\nGrant Permissions \n\nDeliver Grant \n\nInteract with SO through IoT-OAS \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n6 \n\n5 2 3 \n\n4 \n\n1 u2 u1 \n\nu1 u2 \n\nuuid \n\nRead uuid \n\nuuid \n\nuuid \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nIoT-OAS \n\nRegister uuid \n\nDeliver \u201cAll-Access\u201d Grant \n\nInteract with SO through loT-OAS \n\n4 \n\nu1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nFigure 7.17 Speci\ufb01cation of message \ufb02ows for authorization use cases: (a) access to resources for smart object owner; (b) reactive sharing of smart objects; (c) proactive sharing of smart objects. \n\n356 7 The IoT in Practice \n\nUse u1 can read the UUID of the smart object in some way, such as by scanning a QR code. u1 sends a register(IUUID) request to IoT-OAS. Upon verifying the message, IoT-OAS binds the device (and, subsequently, any resource it hosts) to its owner and, at the same time, invalidates any further registration request for the same UUID. In addition, IoT-OAS adds \u201call-access\u201d permissions to u1\u2019s access token. u1 is now authorized to perform any operation on the smart object. All requests targeting the smart object must include the access token, which will be used to validate the request to IoT-OAS\u2019s verify() method. \n\nReactive Owner-to-any Authorization Suppose a user u2 discovers that a smart object owned by u1 is in his proximity and wishes to use it. u2 must be granted a set of permissions to access the smart object\u2019s resources. We assume that u1 and u2 have already logged on to IoT-OAS. The message \ufb02ow for this case is shown in Figure 7.17b. Let P be the set of permissions that u2 requires to access the smart object. To receive the grant, u2 sends a request(UUID, P) message to IoT-OAS, which forwards the message to the owner of the smart object, u1. u1 receives the message and grants a set of permissions Pg, which may di\ufb00er from P. u1 sends a grant(u2, UUID, Pg) message to IoT-OAS, which adds the set of permission to u2\u2019s access token and noti\ufb01es u2 of the result of the operation that he initiated. By including his token in all requests, veri\ufb01ed by IoT-OAS, u2 will be able to access the smart object\u2019s resources. \n\nProactive Owner-to-any Authorization Suppose u1 wants to share the smart object with u2, without u2 explicitly soliciting permission. We assume that u1 and u2 have already logged on to IoT-OAS. The message \ufb02ow for this case is shown in Figure 7.17c and is a simple subset of the operations that occur with the reactive case. u1 sends a grant(u2, UUID, P) message to IoT-OAS, which adds the set of permissions to u2\u2019s access token. At this point, depending on the speci\ufb01c application implementation and/or user settings, there are two ways u2 can receive the grant: \n\n\u2022 using a suitable push noti\ufb01cation service, IoT-OAS noti\ufb01es u2; \u2022 as in the reactive case, after sending a request(UUID) message, u2 will be noti\ufb01ed immediately. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot_p367_i0.png)\n7.5 E\ufb00ective Authorization for the Web of Things 357 \n\n7.5.2 Implementation and Validation \n\nFollowing the de\ufb01nition of the authorization framework, a complete implementation of the proposed architecture has been realized to validate the approach with real smart objects and personal devices. Communication occurs using CoAP/CoAPs, based on the Cal- ifornium library [94] and its DTLS 1.2 module Scandium.26 An Android application as implemented to support the user operations de\ufb01ned by the authorization \ufb02ow. At startup, the user can authenticate through Facebook or Google+, as shown in Figure 7.18a. After the user has logged in, they can view the list of owned and shared devices and the associated permissions, as shown in Figure 7.18b. By clicking on the \ufb02oating \u201cadd\u201d button, the user can register a device they own and that they want to manage, by scanning the QR code associated with it. Figure 7.18c shows the device\u2019s management view, which allows the user to interact with available resources and manage usage permissions with other identi\ufb01ed consumers. The application has been integrated with and tested in our com- pany\u2019s IoT laboratory, enabling us to consider di\ufb00erent scenarios with multiple active users. Through the application, o\ufb03ce employees can, at the same time, interact with available sensors owned by the \n\n\n(a) (b) (c) \n\nFigure 7.18 Main sections of the Android application: (a) platform authentication with Facebook and Google+; (b) list of owned and shared devices; (c) detail view of a speci\ufb01c device with related permissions. \n\n26 https://github.com/eclipse/californium.scandium. \n\n358 7 The IoT in Practice \n\ncompany system administrator (e.g., temperature, light, and humidity) and personal devices on their desk, represented by Philips Hue27 light bulbs. The meeting room was identi\ufb01ed as a common and shared area where, according to appointment schedules, users can dynamically receive access grants from the Sys-admin in order to interact with the room\u2019s equipment \u2013 items such as smart plugs and wireless lighting \u2013 during the meetings. As the IoT and its applications are expected to progressively become an integral part of our lives, security issues must be addressed in order to cope with the concerns that might prevent the spread of IoT products. In general, people will interact with smart objects that they own and with others that they do not own but that can be shared with them. Authorization mechanisms must therefore be introduced in order to take into account the possibility of users wanting to interact with objects that they do not own. In this section, we have presented a standards-based authorization framework for WoT applications, to e\ufb00ectively enforce \ufb01ne-grained policies to access and share IoT resources. The proposed framework allows for a simple and seamless management of access permissions to smart objects. Operation \ufb02ows, relying on the IoT-OAS architecture, have been de\ufb01ned for owner-to-owner and owner-to-any authorization grants. Moreover, a complete implementation of the authorization framework has been realized in order to validate compliance with functional requirements and ease of use. \n\n27 http://www.developers.meethue.com/. \n\n359 \n\nReferences \n\n1 Leiner, B.M., Cerf, V.G., Clark, D.D., Kahn, R.E., Kleinrock, L., Lynch, D.C., Postel, J., Roberts, L.G., and Wol\ufb00, S.
