    "content": "# Internet of Things (IoT) Architecture\n\nThe **Internet of Things (IoT)** refers to the network of physical objects—\"things\"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.\n\n## 1. IoT Architecture Layers\n\nIoT architecture typically consists of four main layers:\n\n### Perception Layer (The Sensing Layer)\nThis layer consists of sensors and actuators that gather data from the environment.\n- **Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, motion, etc.\n- **Actuators**: Motors, switches, etc.\n\n### Network Layer\nResponsible for transmitting data from the perception layer to the processing system.\n- **Protocols**: WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRaWAN, 5G.\n\n### Middleware / Processing Layer\nAnalyzes and processes the data. This often happens in the cloud or at the edge.\n\n### Application Layer\nDelivers the result to the user via interfaces like dashboards, apps, or alerts.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Key IoT Protocols\n\n| Protocol | Range | Power Usage | Data Rate |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **MQTT** | High | Low | Low |\n| **CoAP** | High | Low | Low |\n| **HTTP/REST** | High | High | High |\n| **Zigbee** | Short | Low | Low |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Code Example: Basic ESP32 WiFi Connection\n\nHere is a simple C++ snippet for connecting an ESP32 to WiFi:\n\n```cpp\n#include <WiFi.h>\n\nconst char* ssid = \"Your_SSID\";\nconst char* password = \"Your_PASSWORD\";\n\nvoid setup() {\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);\n\n  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {\n    delay(1000);\n    Serial.println(\"Connecting to WiFi...\");\n  }\n\n  Serial.println(\"Connected to WiFi\");\n}\n\nvoid loop() {\n  // Your IoT logic here\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Challenges in IoT\n- **Security**: Ensuring devices are not hacked.\n- **Interoperability**: Getting devices from different manufacturers to talk to each other.\n- **Scalability**: Managing billions of devices.\n\n> **Note**: This content was AI-generated from your *iot.pdf* file."
