Inheritance is the ability to de\ufb01ne a new class that is a modi\ufb01ed version of an ex- isting class. In this chapter I demonstrate inheritance using classes that represent playing cards, decks of cards, and poker hands. \n\nIf you don\u2019t play poker, you can read about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker, but you don\u2019t have to; I\u2019ll tell you what you need to know for the exercises. \n\nCode examples from this chapter are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/ Card.py. \n\n18.1 Card objects \n\nThere are \ufb01fty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2. \n\nIf we want to de\ufb01ne a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the at- tributes should be: rank and suit. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like 'Spade' for suits and 'Queen' for ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit. \n\nAn alternative is to use integers to encode the ranks and suits. In this context, \u201cencode\u201d means that we are going to de\ufb01ne a mapping between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be \u201cencryption\u201d). \n\nFor example, this table shows the suits and the corresponding integer codes: \n\nSpades 7\u2192 3 Hearts 7\u2192 2 Diamonds 7\u2192 1 Clubs 7\u2192 0 \n\n172 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\nThis code makes it easy to compare cards; because higher suits map to higher numbers, we can compare suits by comparing their codes. \n\nThe mapping for ranks is fairly obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corre- sponding integer, and for face cards: \n\nJack 7\u2192 11 Queen 7\u2192 12 King 7\u2192 13 \n\nI am using the 7\u2192symbol to make it clear that these mappings are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program design, but they don\u2019t appear explicitly in the code. \n\nThe class de\ufb01nition for Card looks like this: \n\nclass Card: \"\"\"Represents a standard playing card.\"\"\" \n\ndef __init__(self, suit=0, rank=2): self.suit = suit self.rank = rank \n\nAs usual, the init method takes an optional parameter for each attribute. The default card is the 2 of Clubs. \n\nTo create a Card, you call Card with the suit and rank of the card you want. \n\nqueen_of_diamonds = Card(1, 12) \n\n18.2 Class attributes \n\nIn order to print Card objects in a way that people can easily read, we need a mapping from the integer codes to the corresponding ranks and suits. A natural way to do that is with lists of strings. We assign these lists to class attributes: \n\n# inside class Card: \n\nsuit_names = ['Clubs', 'Diamonds', 'Hearts', 'Spades'] rank_names = [None, 'Ace', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King'] \n\ndef __str__(self): return '%s of %s' % (Card.rank_names[self.rank], Card.suit_names[self.suit]) \n\nVariables like suit_names and rank_names, which are de\ufb01ned inside a class but outside of any method, are called class attributes because they are associated with the class object Card. \n\nThis term distinguishes them from variables like suit and rank, which are called instance attributes because they are associated with a particular instance. \n\nBoth kinds of attribute are accessed using dot notation. For example, in __str__, self is a Card object, and self.rank is its rank. Similarly, Card is a class object, and Card.rank_names is a list of strings associated with the class. \n\n18.3. Comparing cards 173 \n\nlist \n\nsuit_names \n\nlist \n\nrank_names \n\nCard \n\ntype \n\n1 \n\n11 \n\nsuit \n\nrank \n\ncard1 \n\nCard \n\nFigure 18.1: Object diagram. \n\nEvery card has its own suit and rank, but there is only one copy of suit_names and rank_names. \n\nPutting it all together, the expression Card.rank_names[self.rank] means \u201cuse the at- tribute rank from the object self as an index into the list rank_names from the class Card, and select the appropriate string.\u201d \n\nThe \ufb01rst element of rank_names is None because there is no card with rank zero. By includ- ing None as a place-keeper, we get a mapping with the nice property that the index 2 maps to the string '2', and so on. To avoid this tweak, we could have used a dictionary instead of a list. \n\nWith the methods we have so far, we can create and print cards: \n\n>>> card1 = Card(2, 11) >>> print(card1) Jack of Hearts \n\nFigure 18.1 is a diagram of the Card class object and one Card instance. Card is a class object; its type is type. card1 is an instance of Card, so its type is Card. To save space, I didn\u2019t draw the contents of suit_names and rank_names. \n\n18.3 Comparing cards \n\nFor built-in types, there are relational operators (<, >, ==, etc.) that compare values and de- termine when one is greater than, less than, or equal to another. For programmer-de\ufb01ned types, we can override the behavior of the built-in operators by providing a method named __lt__, which stands for \u201cless than\u201d. \n\n__lt__ takes two parameters, self and other, and returns True if self is strictly less than other. \n\nThe correct ordering for cards is not obvious. For example, which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a higher rank, but the other has a higher suit. In order to compare cards, you have to decide whether rank or suit is more important. \n\nThe answer might depend on what game you are playing, but to keep things simple, we\u2019ll make the arbitrary choice that suit is more important, so all of the Spades outrank all of the Diamonds, and so on. \n\n174 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\nWith that decided, we can write __lt__: \n\n# inside class Card: \n\ndef __lt__(self, other): # check the suits if self.suit < other.suit: return True if self.suit > other.suit: return False \n\n# suits are the same... check ranks return self.rank < other.rank \n\nYou can write this more concisely using tuple comparison: \n\n# inside class Card: \n\ndef __lt__(self, other): t1 = self.suit, self.rank t2 = other.suit, other.rank return t1 < t2 \n\nAs an exercise, write an __lt__ method for Time objects. You can use tuple comparison, but you also might consider comparing integers. \n\n18.4 Decks \n\nNow that we have Cards, the next step is to de\ufb01ne Decks. Since a deck is made up of cards, it is natural for each Deck to contain a list of cards as an attribute. \n\nThe following is a class de\ufb01nition for Deck. The init method creates the attribute cards and generates the standard set of \ufb01fty-two cards: \n\nclass Deck: \n\ndef __init__(self): self.cards = [] for suit in range(4): for rank in range(1, 14): card = Card(suit, rank) self.cards.append(card) \n\nThe easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer loop enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the ranks from 1 to 13. Each iteration creates a new Card with the current suit and rank, and appends it to self.cards. \n\n18.5 Printing the deck \n\nHere is a __str__ method for Deck: \n\n# inside class Deck: \n\ndef __str__(self): res = [] \n\n18.6. Add, remove, shuf\ufb02e and sort 175 \n\nfor card in self.cards: res.append(str(card)) return '\\n'.join(res) \n\nThis method demonstrates an ef\ufb01cient way to accumulate a large string: building a list of strings and then using the string method join. The built-in function str invokes the __str__ method on each card and returns the string representation. \n\nSince we invoke join on a newline character, the cards are separated by newlines. Here\u2019s what the result looks like: \n\n>>> deck = Deck() >>> print(deck) Ace of Clubs 2 of Clubs 3 of Clubs ... 10 of Spades Jack of Spades Queen of Spades King of Spades \n\nEven though the result appears on 52 lines, it is one long string that contains newlines. \n\n18.6 Add, remove, shuf\ufb02e and sort \n\nTo deal cards, we would like a method that removes a card from the deck and returns it. The list method pop provides a convenient way to do that: \n\n# inside class Deck: \n\ndef pop_card(self): return self.cards.pop() \n\nSince pop removes the last card in the list, we are dealing from the bottom of the deck. \n\nTo add a card, we can use the list method append: \n\n# inside class Deck: \n\ndef add_card(self, card): self.cards.append(card) \n\nA method like this that uses another method without doing much work is sometimes called a veneer. The metaphor comes from woodworking, where a veneer is a thin layer of good quality wood glued to the surface of a cheaper piece of wood to improve the appearance. \n\nIn this case add_card is a \u201cthin\u201d method that expresses a list operation in terms appropriate for decks. It improves the appearance, or interface, of the implementation. \n\nAs another example, we can write a Deck method named shuffle using the function shuffle from the random module: \n\n# inside class Deck: \n\ndef shuffle(self): random.shuffle(self.cards) \n\n176 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\nDon\u2019t forget to import random. \n\nAs an exercise, write a Deck method named sort that uses the list method sort to sort the cards in a Deck. sort uses the __lt__ method we de\ufb01ned to determine the order. \n\n18.7 Inheritance \n\nInheritance is the ability to de\ufb01ne a new class that is a modi\ufb01ed version of an existing class. As an example, let\u2019s say we want a class to represent a \u201chand\u201d, that is, the cards held by one player. A hand is similar to a deck: both are made up of a collection of cards, and both require operations like adding and removing cards. \n\nA hand is also different from a deck; there are operations we want for hands that don\u2019t make sense for a deck. For example, in poker we might compare two hands to see which one wins. In bridge, we might compute a score for a hand in order to make a bid. \n\nThis relationship between classes\u2014similar, but different\u2014lends itself to inheritance. To de\ufb01ne a new class that inherits from an existing class, you put the name of the existing class in parentheses: \n\nclass Hand(Deck): \"\"\"Represents a hand of playing cards.\"\"\" \n\nThis de\ufb01nition indicates that Hand inherits from Deck; that means we can use methods like pop_card and add_card for Hands as well as Decks. \n\nWhen a new class inherits from an existing one, the existing one is called the parent and the new class is called the child. \n\nIn this example, Hand inherits __init__ from Deck, but it doesn\u2019t really do what we want: instead of populating the hand with 52 new cards, the init method for Hands should ini- tialize cards with an empty list. \n\nIf we provide an init method in the Hand class, it overrides the one in the Deck class: \n\n# inside class Hand: \n\ndef __init__(self, label=''): self.cards = [] self.label = label \n\nWhen you create a Hand, Python invokes this init method, not the one in Deck. \n\n>>> hand = Hand('new hand') >>> hand.cards [] >>> hand.label 'new hand' \n\nThe other methods are inherited from Deck, so we can use pop_card and add_card to deal a card: \n\n>>> deck = Deck() >>> card = deck.pop_card() >>> hand.add_card(card) >>> print(hand) King of Spades \n\n18.8. Class diagrams 177 \n\nA natural next step is to encapsulate this code in a method called move_cards: \n\n# inside class Deck: \n\ndef move_cards(self, hand, num): for i in range(num): hand.add_card(self.pop_card()) \n\nmove_cards takes two arguments, a Hand object and the number of cards to deal. It modi- \ufb01es both self and hand, and returns None. \n\nIn some games, cards are moved from one hand to another, or from a hand back to the deck. You can use move_cards for any of these operations: self can be either a Deck or a Hand, and hand, despite the name, can also be a Deck. \n\nInheritance is a useful feature. Some programs that would be repetitive without inheritance can be written more elegantly with it. Inheritance can facilitate code reuse, since you can customize the behavior of parent classes without having to modify them. In some cases, the inheritance structure re\ufb02ects the natural structure of the problem, which makes the design easier to understand. \n\nOn the other hand, inheritance can make programs dif\ufb01cult to read. When a method is invoked, it is sometimes not clear where to \ufb01nd its de\ufb01nition. The relevant code may be spread across several modules. Also, many of the things that can be done using inheritance can be done as well or better without it. \n\n18.8 Class diagrams \n\nSo far we have seen stack diagrams, which show the state of a program, and object dia- grams, which show the attributes of an object and their values. These diagrams represent a snapshot in the execution of a program, so they change as the program runs. \n\nThey are also highly detailed; for some purposes, too detailed. A class diagram is a more abstract representation of the structure of a program. Instead of showing individual ob- jects, it shows classes and the relationships between them. \n\nThere are several kinds of relationship between classes: \n\n\u2022 Objects in one class might contain references to objects in another class. For example, each Rectangle contains a reference to a Point, and each Deck contains references to many Cards. This kind of relationship is called HAS-A, as in, \u201ca Rectangle has a Point.\u201d \n\n\u2022 One class might inherit from another. This relationship is called IS-A, as in, \u201ca Hand is a kind of a Deck.\u201d \n\n\u2022 One class might depend on another in the sense that objects in one class take ob- jects in the second class as parameters, or use objects in the second class as part of a computation. This kind of relationship is called a dependency. \n\nA class diagram is a graphical representation of these relationships. For example, Fig- ure 18.2 shows the relationships between Card, Deck and Hand. \n\n178 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\nHand \n\nDeck * Card \n\nFigure 18.2: Class diagram. \n\nThe arrow with a hollow triangle head represents an IS-A relationship; in this case it indi- cates that Hand inherits from Deck. \n\nThe standard arrow head represents a HAS-A relationship; in this case a Deck has refer- ences to Card objects. \n\nThe star (*) near the arrow head is a multiplicity; it indicates how many Cards a Deck has. A multiplicity can be a simple number, like 52, a range, like 5..7 or a star, which indicates that a Deck can have any number of Cards. \n\nThere are no dependencies in this diagram. They would normally be shown with a dashed arrow. Or if there are a lot of dependencies, they are sometimes omitted. \n\nA more detailed diagram might show that a Deck actually contains a list of Cards, but built-in types like list and dict are usually not included in class diagrams. \n\n18.9 Debugging \n\nInheritance can make debugging dif\ufb01cult because when you invoke a method on an object, it might be hard to \ufb01gure out which method will be invoked. \n\nSuppose you are writing a function that works with Hand objects. You would like it to work with all kinds of Hands, like PokerHands, BridgeHands, etc. If you invoke a method like shuffle, you might get the one de\ufb01ned in Deck, but if any of the subclasses override this method, you\u2019ll get that version instead. This behavior is usually a good thing, but it can be confusing. \n\nAny time you are unsure about the \ufb02ow of execution through your program, the sim- plest solution is to add print statements at the beginning of the relevant methods. If Deck.shuffle prints a message that says something like Running Deck.shuffle, then as the program runs it traces the \ufb02ow of execution. \n\nAs an alternative, you could use this function, which takes an object and a method name (as a string) and returns the class that provides the de\ufb01nition of the method: \n\ndef find_defining_class(obj, meth_name): for ty in type(obj).mro(): if meth_name in ty.__dict__: return ty \n\nHere\u2019s an example: \n\n>>> hand = Hand() >>> find_defining_class(hand, 'shuffle') <class '__main__.Deck'> \n\n18.10. Data encapsulation 179 \n\nSo the shuffle method for this Hand is the one in Deck. \n\nfind_defining_class uses the mro method to get the list of class objects (types) that will be searched for methods. \u201cMRO\u201d stands for \u201cmethod resolution order\u201d, which is the sequence of classes Python searches to \u201cresolve\u201d a method name. \n\nHere\u2019s a design suggestion: when you override a method, the interface of the new method should be the same as the old. It should take the same parameters, return the same type, and obey the same preconditions and postconditions. If you follow this rule, you will \ufb01nd that any function designed to work with an instance of a parent class, like a Deck, will also work with instances of child classes like a Hand and PokerHand. \n\nIf you violate this rule, which is called the \u201cLiskov substitution principle\u201d, your code will collapse like (sorry) a house of cards. \n\n18.10 Data encapsulation \n\nThe previous chapters demonstrate a development plan we might call \u201cobject-oriented design\u201d. We identi\ufb01ed objects we needed\u2014like Point, Rectangle and Time\u2014and de\ufb01ned classes to represent them. In each case there is an obvious correspondence between the object and some entity in the real world (or at least a mathematical world). \n\nBut sometimes it is less obvious what objects you need and how they should interact. In that case you need a different development plan. In the same way that we discovered function interfaces by encapsulation and generalization, we can discover class interfaces by data encapsulation. \n\nMarkov analysis, from Section 13.8, provides a good example. If you download my code from https://thinkpython.com/code/markov.py, you\u2019ll see that it uses two global variables\u2014suffix_map and prefix\u2014that are read and written from several functions. \n\nsuffix_map = {} prefix = () \n\nBecause these variables are global, we can only run one analysis at a time. If we read two texts, their pre\ufb01xes and suf\ufb01xes would be added to the same data structures (which makes for some interesting generated text). \n\nTo run multiple analyses, and keep them separate, we can encapsulate the state of each analysis in an object. Here\u2019s what that looks like: \n\nclass Markov: \n\ndef __init__(self): self.suffix_map = {} self.prefix = () \n\nNext, we transform the functions into methods. For example, here\u2019s process_word: \n\ndef process_word(self, word, order=2): if len(self.prefix) < order: self.prefix += (word,) return \n\n180 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\ntry: self.suffix_map[self.prefix].append(word) except KeyError: # if there is no entry for this prefix, make one self.suffix_map[self.prefix] = [word] \n\nself.prefix = shift(self.prefix, word) \n\nTransforming a program like this\u2014changing the design without changing the behavior\u2014is another example of refactoring (see Section 4.7). \n\nThis example suggests a development plan for designing objects and methods: \n\n1. Start by writing functions that read and write global variables (when necessary). \n\n2. Once you get the program working, look for associations between global variables and the functions that use them. \n\n3. Encapsulate related variables as attributes of an object. \n\n4. Transform the associated functions into methods of the new class. \n\nAs an exercise, download my Markov code from https://thinkpython.com/code/ markov.py, and follow the steps described above to encapsulate the global variables as attributes of a new class called Markov. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/ markov2.py. \n\n18.11 Glossary \n\nencode: To represent one set of values using another set of values by constructing a map- ping between them. \n\nclass attribute: An attribute associated with a class object.

For the following program, draw a UML class diagram that shows these classes and the relationships among them. \n\nclass PingPongParent: pass \n\nclass Ping(PingPongParent): def __init__(self, pong): self.pong = pong \n\nclass Pong(PingPongParent): def __init__(self, pings=None): if pings is None: self.pings = [] else: self.pings = pings \n\ndef add_ping(self, ping): self.pings.append(ping) \n\npong = Pong() ping = Ping(pong) pong.add_ping(ping) Exercise 18.2. Write a Deck method called deal_hands that takes two parameters, the number of hands and the number of cards per hand. It should create the appropriate number of Hand objects, deal the appropriate number of cards per hand, and return a list of Hands. Exercise 18.3. The following are the possible hands in poker, in increasing order of value and decreasing order of probability: \n\npair: two cards with the same rank \n\ntwo pair: two pairs of cards with the same rank \n\nthree of a kind: three cards with the same rank \n\nstraight: \ufb01ve cards with ranks in sequence (aces can be high or low, so Ace-2-3-4-5 is a straight and so is 10-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, but Queen-King-Ace-2-3 is not.) \n\n\ufb02ush: \ufb01ve cards with the same suit \n\nfull house: three cards with one rank, two cards with another \n\n182 Chapter 18. Inheritance \n\nfour of a kind: four cards with the same rank \n\nstraight \ufb02ush: \ufb01ve cards in sequence (as de\ufb01ned above) and with the same suit \n\nThe goal of these exercises is to estimate the probability of drawing these various hands. \n\n1. Download the following \ufb01les from https: // thinkpython. com/ code : \n\nCard.py : A complete version of the Card, Deck and Hand classes in this chapter. \n\nPokerHand.py : An incomplete implementation of a class that represents a poker hand, and some code that tests it. \n\n2. If you run PokerHand.py, it deals seven 7-card poker hands and checks to see if any of them contains a \ufb02ush. Read this code carefully before you go on. \n\n3. Add methods to PokerHand.py named has_pair, has_twopair, etc. that return True or False according to whether or not the hand meets the relevant criteria. Your code should work correctly for \u201chands\u201d that contain any number of cards (although 5 and 7 are the most common sizes). \n\n4. Write a method named classify that \ufb01gures out the highest-value classi\ufb01cation for a hand and sets the label attribute accordingly. For example, a 7-card hand might contain a \ufb02ush and a pair; it should be labeled \u201c\ufb02ush\u201d. \n\n5. When you are convinced that your classi\ufb01cation methods are working, the next step is to esti- mate the probabilities of the various hands. Write a function in PokerHand.py that shuf\ufb02es a deck of cards, divides it into hands, classi\ufb01es the hands, and counts the number of times various classi\ufb01cations appear. \n\n6. Print a table of the classi\ufb01cations and their probabilities. Run your program with larger and larger numbers of hands until the output values converge to a reasonable degree of accu- racy.
