  "content": "# Fruitful functions\n\n\n\nMany of the Python functions we have used, such as the math functions, produce return values. But the functions we\u2019ve written are all void: they have an effect, like printing a value or moving a turtle, but they don\u2019t have a return value. In this chapter you will learn to write fruitful functions. \n\n6.1 Return values \n\nCalling the function generates a return value, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an expression. \n\ne = math.exp(1.0) height = radius * math.sin(radians) \n\nThe functions we have written so far are void. Speaking casually, they have no return value; more precisely, their return value is None. \n\nIn this chapter, we are (\ufb01nally) going to write fruitful functions. The \ufb01rst example is area, which returns the area of a circle with the given radius: \n\ndef area(radius): a = math.pi * radius**2 return a \n\nWe have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful function the return statement includes an expression. This statement means: \u201cReturn immediately from this function and use the following expression as a return value.\u201d The expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could have written this function more concisely: \n\ndef area(radius): return math.pi * radius**2 \n\nOn the other hand, temporary variables like a can make debugging easier. \n\nSometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each branch of a condi- tional: \n\n52 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions \n\ndef absolute_value(x): if x < 0: return -x else: return x \n\nSince these return statements are in an alternative conditional, only one runs. \n\nAs soon as a return statement runs, the function terminates without executing any subse- quent statements. Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the \ufb02ow of execution can never reach, is called dead code. \n\nIn a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure that every possible path through the pro- gram hits a return statement. For example: \n\ndef absolute_value(x): if x < 0: return -x if x > 0: return x \n\nThis function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0, neither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a return statement. If the \ufb02ow of execution gets to the end of a function, the return value is None, which is not the absolute value of 0. \n\n>>> print(absolute_value(0)) None \n\nBy the way, Python provides a built-in function called abs that computes absolute values. \n\nAs an exercise, write a compare function that takes two values, x and y, and returns 1 if x > y, 0 if x == y, and -1 if x < y. \n\n6.2 Incremental development \n\nAs you write larger functions, you might \ufb01nd yourself spending more time debugging. \n\nTo deal with increasingly complex programs, you might want to try a process called in- cremental development. The goal of incremental development is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time. \n\nAs an example, suppose you want to \ufb01nd the distance between two points, given by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is: \n\ndistance = q \n\n(x2 \u2212x1)2 + (y2 \u2212y1)2 \n\nThe \ufb01rst step is to consider what a distance function should look like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters) and what is the output (return value)? \n\nIn this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent using four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by a \ufb02oating-point value. \n\nImmediately you can write an outline of the function: \n\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): return 0.0 \n\n6.2. Incremental development 53 \n\nObviously, this version doesn\u2019t compute distances; it always returns zero. But it is syn- tactically correct, and it runs, which means that you can test it before you make it more complicated. \n\nTo test the new function, call it with sample arguments: >>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6) 0.0 I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the vertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse of a 3-4-5 right triangle. When testing a function, it is useful to know the right answer. \n\nAt this point we have con\ufb01rmed that the function is syntactically correct, and we can start adding code to the body. A reasonable next step is to \ufb01nd the differences x2 \u2212x1 and y2 \u2212y1. The next version stores those values in temporary variables and prints them. def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): dx = x2 - x1 dy = y2 - y1 print('dx is', dx) print('dy is', dy) return 0.0 If the function is working, it should display dx is 3 and dy is 4. If so, we know that the function is getting the right arguments and performing the \ufb01rst computation correctly. If not, there are only a few lines to check. \n\nNext we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy: def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): dx = x2 - x1 dy = y2 - y1 dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2 print('dsquared is: ', dsquared) return 0.0 Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output (which should be 25). Finally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result: def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): dx = x2 - x1 dy = y2 - y1 dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2 result = math.sqrt(dsquared) return result If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might want to print the value of result before the return statement. \n\nThe \ufb01nal version of the function doesn\u2019t display anything when it runs; it only returns a value. The print statements we wrote are useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you should remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the \ufb01nal product. \n\nWhen you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a time. As you gain more experience, you might \ufb01nd yourself writing and debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development can save you a lot of debugging time. \n\nThe key aspects of the process are: \n\n54 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions \n\n1. Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea where it is. \n\n2. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can display and check them. \n\n3. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of the scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound expressions, but only if it does not make the program dif\ufb01cult to read. \n\nAs an exercise, use incremental development to write a function called hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments. Record each stage of the development process as you go. \n\n6.3 Composition \n\nAs you should expect by now, you can call one function from within another. As an exam- ple, we\u2019ll write a function that takes two points, the center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes the area of the circle. \n\nAssume that the center point is stored in the variables xc and yc, and the perimeter point is in xp and yp. The \ufb01rst step is to \ufb01nd the radius of the circle, which is the distance between the two points. We just wrote a function, distance, that does that: \n\nradius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp) \n\nThe next step is to \ufb01nd the area of a circle with that radius; we just wrote that, too: \n\nresult = area(radius) \n\nEncapsulating these steps in a function, we get: \n\ndef circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp): radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp) result = area(radius) return result \n\nThe temporary variables radius and result are useful for development and debugging, but once the program is working, we can make it more concise by composing the function calls: \n\ndef circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp): return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)) \n\n6.4 Boolean functions \n\nFunctions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding complicated tests in- side functions. For example: \n\ndef is_divisible(x, y): if x % y == 0: return True else: return False \n\n6.5. More recursion 55 \n\nIt is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no questions; is_divisible returns either True or False to indicate whether x is divisible by y. \n\nHere is an example: >>> is_divisible(6, 4) False >>> is_divisible(6, 3) True The result of the == operator is a boolean, so we can write the function more concisely by returning it directly: def is_divisible(x, y): return x % y == 0 Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements: if is_divisible(x, y): print('x is divisible by y') It might be tempting to write something like: if is_divisible(x, y) == True: print('x is divisible by y') But the extra comparison is unnecessary. \n\nAs an exercise, write a function is_between(x, y, z) that returns True if x \u2264y \u2264z or False otherwise. \n\n6.5 More recursion \n\nWe have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might be interested to know that this subset is a complete programming language, which means that anything that can be computed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written could be rewritten using only the language features you have learned so far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices like the mouse, disks, etc., but that\u2019s all). \n\nProving that claim is a nontrivial exercise \ufb01rst accomplished by Alan Turing, one of the \ufb01rst computer scientists (some would argue that he was a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as mathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis. For a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis, I recommend Michael Sipser\u2019s book Introduction to the Theory of Computation. \n\nTo give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned so far, we\u2019ll eval- uate a few recursively de\ufb01ned mathematical functions. A recursive de\ufb01nition is similar to a circular de\ufb01nition, in the sense that the de\ufb01nition contains a reference to the thing being de\ufb01ned. A truly circular de\ufb01nition is not very useful: \n\nvorpal: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal. \n\nIf you saw that de\ufb01nition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On the other hand, if you looked up the de\ufb01nition of the factorial function, denoted with the symbol !, you might get something like this: \n\n0! = 1 \n\nn! = n(n \u22121)! \n\n56 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions \n\nThis de\ufb01nition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of any other value, n, is n multiplied by the factorial of n \u22121. \n\nSo 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times 0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1, which is 6. \n\nIf you can write a recursive de\ufb01nition of something, you can write a Python program to evaluate it. The \ufb01rst step is to decide what the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear that factorial takes an integer: \n\ndef factorial(n): \n\nIf the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1: \n\ndef factorial(n): if n == 0: return 1 \n\nOtherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a recursive call to \ufb01nd the factorial of n \u22121 and then multiply it by n: \n\ndef factorial(n): if n == 0: return 1 else: recurse = factorial(n-1) result = n * recurse return result \n\nThe \ufb02ow of execution for this program is similar to the \ufb02ow of countdown in Section 5.8. If we call factorial with the value 3: \n\nSince 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... \n\nSince 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... \n\nSince 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1... \n\nSince 0 equals 0, we take the \ufb01rst branch and return 1 without making any more recursive calls. \n\nThe return value, 1, is multiplied by n, which is 1, and the result is returned. \n\nThe return value, 1, is multiplied by n, which is 2, and the result is returned. \n\nThe return value (2) is multiplied by n, which is 3, and the result, 6, becomes the return value of the function call that started the whole process. \n\nFigure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for this sequence of function calls. \n\nThe return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each frame, the return value is the value of result, which is the product of n and recurse. \n\nIn the last frame, the local variables recurse and result do not exist, because the branch that creates them does not run. \n\n6.6. Leap of faith 57 \n\nn 3 recurse 2 \n\nrecurse 1 \n\nrecurse 1 \n\n__main__ \n\nfactorial \n\nn 2 \n\nn 1 \n\nn 0 \n\nfactorial \n\nfactorial \n\nfactorial 1 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n6 \n\n1 result \n\n2 \n\n6 result \n\nresult \n\nFigure 6.1: Stack diagram. \n\n6.6 Leap of faith \n\nFollowing the \ufb02ow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become overwhelming. An alternative is what I call the \u201cleap of faith\u201d. When you come to a function call, instead of following the \ufb02ow of execution, you assume that the function works correctly and returns the right result. \n\nIn fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use built-in functions. When you call math.cos or math.exp, you don\u2019t examine the bodies of those functions. You just assume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in functions were good programmers. \n\nThe same is true when you call one of your own functions. For example, in Section 6.4, we wrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by another. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is correct\u2014by examining the code and testing\u2014we can use the function without looking at the body again. \n\nThe same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive call, instead of following the \ufb02ow of execution, you should assume that the recursive call works (returns the correct result) and then ask yourself, \u201cAssuming that I can \ufb01nd the factorial of n \u22121, can I compute the factorial of n?\u201d It is clear that you can, by multiplying by n. \n\nOf course, it\u2019s a bit strange to assume that the function works correctly when you haven\u2019t \ufb01nished writing it, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s called a leap of faith! \n\n6.7 One more example \n\nAfter factorial, the most common example of a recursively de\ufb01ned mathematical func- tion is fibonacci, which has the following de\ufb01nition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Fibonacci_number): \n\n\ufb01bonacci(0) = 0 \n\n\ufb01bonacci(1) = 1 \n\n\ufb01bonacci(n) = \ufb01bonacci(n \u22121) + \ufb01bonacci(n \u22122) \n\nTranslated into Python, it looks like this: \n\n58 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions \n\ndef fibonacci(n): if n == 0: return 0 elif n == 1: return 1 else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) \n\nIf you try to follow the \ufb02ow of execution here, even for fairly small values of n, your head explodes. But according to the leap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls work correctly, then it is clear that you get the right result by adding them together. \n\n6.8 Checking types \n\nWhat happens if we call factorial and give it 1.5 as an argument? \n\n>>> factorial(1.5) RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded \n\nIt looks like an in\ufb01nite recursion. How can that be? The function has a base case\u2014when n == 0. But if n is not an integer, we can miss the base case and recurse forever. \n\nIn the \ufb01rst recursive call, the value of n is 0.5. In the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets smaller (more negative), but it will never be 0. \n\nWe have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with \ufb02oating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The \ufb01rst option is called the gamma function and it\u2019s a little beyond the scope of this book. So we\u2019ll go for the second. \n\nWe can use the built-in function isinstance to verify the type of the argument. While we\u2019re at it, we can also make sure the argument is positive: \n\ndef factorial(n): if not isinstance(n, int): print('Factorial is only defined for integers.') return None elif n < 0: print('Factorial is not defined for negative integers.') return None elif n == 0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n-1) \n\nThe \ufb01rst base case handles nonintegers; the second handles negative integers. In both cases, the program prints an error message and returns None to indicate that something went wrong: \n\n>>> print(factorial('fred')) Factorial is only defined for integers. None >>> print(factorial(-2)) Factorial is not defined for negative integers. None \n\n6.9. Debugging 59 \n\nIf we get past both checks, we know that n is a non-negative integer, so we can prove that the recursion terminates. \n\nThis program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a guardian. The \ufb01rst two condi- tionals act as guardians, protecting the code that follows from values that might cause an error. The guardians make it possible to prove the correctness of the code. \n\nIn Section 11.4 we will see a more \ufb02exible alternative to printing an error message: raising an exception. \n\n6.9 Debugging \n\nBreaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural checkpoints for debugging. If a function is not working, there are three possibilities to consider: \n\n\u2022 There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting; a precondition is violated. \n\n\u2022 There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition is violated. \n\n\u2022 There is something wrong with the return value or the way it is being used. \n\nTo rule out the \ufb01rst possibility, you can add a print statement at the beginning of the function and display the values of the parameters (and maybe their types). Or you can write code that checks the preconditions explicitly. \n\nIf the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and display the return value. If possible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the function with values that make it easy to check the result (as in Section 6.2). \n\nIf the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used at all!). \n\nAdding print statements at the beginning and end of a function can help make the \ufb02ow of execution more visible. For example, here is a version of factorial with print statements: \n\ndef factorial(n): space = ' ' * (4 * n) print(space, 'factorial', n) if n == 0: print(space, 'returning 1') return 1 else: recurse = factorial(n-1) result = n * recurse print(space, 'returning', result) return result \n\nspace is a string of space characters that controls the indentation of the output. Here is the result of factorial(4) : \n\n60 Chapter 6. Fruitful functions \n\nfactorial 4 factorial 3 factorial 2 factorial 1 factorial 0 returning 1 returning 1 returning 2 returning 6 returning 24 \n\nIf you are confused about the \ufb02ow of execution, this kind of output can be helpful. It takes some time to develop effective scaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging. \n\n6.10 Glossary \n\ntemporary variable: A variable used to store an intermediate value in a complex calcula- tion. \n\ndead code: Part of a program that can never run, often because it appears after a return statement. \n\nincremental development: A program development plan intended to avoid debugging by adding and testing only a small amount of code at a time. \n\nscaffolding: Code that is used during program development but is not part of the \ufb01nal version. \n\nguardian: A programming pattern that uses a conditional statement to check for and han- dle circumstances that might cause an error. \n\n6.11 Exercises \n\nExercise 6.1. Draw a stack diagram for the following program. What does the program print? \n\ndef b(z): prod = a(z, z) print(z, prod) return prod \n\ndef a(x, y): x = x + 1 return x * y \n\ndef c(x, y, z): total = x + y + z square = b(total)**2 return square \n\n6.11. Exercises 61 \n\nx = 1 y = x + 1 print(c(x, y+3, x+y)) Exercise 6.2. The Ackermann function, A(m, n), is de\ufb01ned: \n\nA(m, n) = \n\n\uf8f1 \uf8f4 \uf8f2 \n\n\uf8f4 \uf8f3 \n\nn + 1 if m = 0 A(m \u22121, 1) if m > 0 and n = 0 A(m \u22121, A(m, n \u22121)) if m > 0 and n > 0. \n\nSee http: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Ackermann_ function . Write a function named ack that evaluates the Ackermann function. Use your function to evaluate ack(3, 4), which should be 125. What happens for larger values of m and n? Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ ackermann. py . Exercise 6.3. A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and forward, like \u201cnoon\u201d and \u201credivider\u201d. Recursively, a word is a palindrome if the \ufb01rst and last letters are the same and the middle is a palindrome. \n\nThe following are functions that take a string argument and return the \ufb01rst, last, and middle letters: \n\ndef first(word): return word[0] \n\ndef last(word): return word[-1] \n\ndef middle(word): return word[1:-1] \n\nWe\u2019ll see how they work in Chapter 8. \n\n1. Type these functions into a \ufb01le named palindrome.py and test them out. What happens if you call middle with a string with two letters? One letter? What about the empty string, which is written '' and contains no letters? \n\n2. Write a function called is_palindrome that takes a string argument and returns True if it is a palindrome and False otherwise. Remember that you can use the built-in function len to check the length of a string. \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ palindrome_ soln. py . Exercise 6.4. A number, a, is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a/b is a power of b. Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b. Note: you will have to think about the base case. Exercise 6.5. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number that divides both of them with no remainder. \n\nOne way to \ufb01nd the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation that if r is the remainder when a is divided by b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). As a base case, we can use gcd(a, 0) = a. \n\nWrite a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor. \n\nCredit: This exercise is based on an example from Abelson and Sussman\u2019s Structure and Interpre- tation of Computer Programs. \n\n62 Chapter 6.
