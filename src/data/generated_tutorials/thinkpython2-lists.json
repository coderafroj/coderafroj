You will also learn \nmore about objects and what can happen when you have more than one name for the same \nobject. \n\n10.1 \nA list is a sequence \n\nLike a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, \nthey can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or sometimes items . \n\nThere are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square \nbrackets ( [ and ] ): \n\n[10, 20, 30, 40] \n['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit'] \n\nThe \ufb01rst example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements \nof a list don\u2019t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a \ufb02oat, an \ninteger, and (lo!) another list: \n\n['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]] \n\nA list within another list is nested . \n\nA list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty \nbrackets, [] . \n\nAs you might expect, you can assign list values to variables: \n\n>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] \n>>> numbers = [42, 123] \n>>> empty = [] \n>>> print(cheeses, numbers, empty) \n['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [42, 123] [] \n\n90 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\nlist \n\nnumbers \n\n123 \n\n5 \n\nlist \n\nempty \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\u2019Cheddar\u2019 \n\n\u2019Edam\u2019 \n\n\u2019Gouda\u2019 \n\nlist \n\ncheeses \n\n42 \n\nFigure 10.1: State diagram. \n\n10.2 \nLists are mutable \n\nThe syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters \nof a string\u2014the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets speci\ufb01es the index. \nRemember that the indices start at 0: \n>>> cheeses[0] \n'Cheddar' \nUnlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an \nassignment, it identi\ufb01es the element of the list that will be assigned. \n>>> numbers = [42, 123] \n>>> numbers[1] = 5 \n>>> numbers \n[42, 5] \nThe one-eth element of numbers , which used to be 123, is now 5. \n\nFigure 10.1 shows the state diagram for cheeses , numbers and empty . \n\nLists are represented by boxes with the word \u201clist\u201d outside and the elements of the list \ninside. cheeses refers to a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2. numbers contains \ntwo elements; the diagram shows that the value of the second element has been reassigned \nfrom 123 to 5. empty refers to a list with no elements. \n\nList indices work the same way as string indices: \n\n\u2022 Any integer expression can be used as an index. \n\n\u2022 If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError . \n\n\u2022 If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list. \n\nThe in operator also works on lists. \n>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] \n>>> 'Edam' in cheeses \nTrue \n>>> 'Brie' in cheeses \nFalse \n\n10.3. Traversing a list \n91 \n\n10.3 \nTraversing a list \n\nThe most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop. The syntax is \nthe same as for strings: \n\nfor cheese in cheeses: \nprint(cheese) \n\nThis works well if you only need to read the elements of the list. But if you want to write \nor update the elements, you need the indices. A common way to do that is to combine the \nbuilt-in functions range and len : \n\nfor i in range(len(numbers)): \nnumbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2 \n\nThis loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of elements \nin the list. range returns a list of indices from 0 to n \u2212 1, where n is the length of the list. \nEach time through the loop i gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement \nin the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value. \n\nA for loop over an empty list never runs the body: \n\nfor x in []: \nprint('This never happens.') \n\nAlthough a list can contain another list, the nested list still counts as a single element. The \nlength of this list is four: \n\n['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]] \n\n10.4 \nList operations \n\nThe + operator concatenates lists: \n\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> b = [4, 5, 6] \n>>> c = a + b \n>>> c \n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \n\nThe * operator repeats a list a given number of times: \n\n>>> [0] * 4 \n[0, 0, 0, 0] \n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3 \n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] \n\nThe \ufb01rst example repeats [0] four times. The second example repeats the list [1, 2, 3] \nthree times. \n\n10.5 \nList slices \n\nThe slice operator also works on lists: \n\n92 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] \n>>> t[1:3] \n['b', 'c'] \n>>> t[:4] \n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] \n>>> t[3:] \n['d', 'e', 'f'] \n\nIf you omit the \ufb01rst index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice \ngoes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list. \n\n>>> t[:] \n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] \n\nSince lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations that \nmodify lists. \n\nA slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements: \n\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] \n>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y'] \n>>> t \n['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f'] \n\n10.6 \nList methods \n\nPython provides methods that operate on lists. For example, append adds a new element \nto the end of a list: \n\n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> t.append('d') \n>>> t \n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] \n\nextend takes a list as an argument and appends all of the elements: \n\n>>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> t2 = ['d', 'e'] \n>>> t1.extend(t2) \n>>> t1 \n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] \n\nThis example leaves t2 unmodi\ufb01ed. \n\nsort arranges the elements of the list from low to high: \n\n>>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a'] \n>>> t.sort() \n>>> t \n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] \n\nMost list methods are void; they modify the list and return None . If you accidentally write \nt = t.sort() , you will be disappointed with the result. \n\n10.7. Map, \ufb01lter and reduce \n93 \n\n10.7 \nMap, \ufb01lter and reduce \n\nTo add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this: \n\ndef add_all(t): \ntotal = 0 \nfor x in t: \ntotal += x \nreturn total \n\ntotal is initialized to 0. Each time through the loop, x gets one element from the list. \nThe += operator provides a short way to update a variable. This augmented assignment \nstatement , \n\ntotal += x \n\nis equivalent to \n\ntotal = total + x \n\nAs the loop runs, total accumulates the sum of the elements; a variable used this way is \nsometimes called an accumulator . \n\nAdding up the elements of a list is such a common operation that Python provides it as a \nbuilt-in function, sum : \n\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> sum(t) \n6 \n\nAn operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into a single value is some- \ntimes called reduce . \n\nSometimes you want to traverse one list while building another. For example, the following \nfunction takes a list of strings and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings: \n\ndef capitalize_all(t): \nres = [] \nfor s in t: \nres.append(s.capitalize()) \nreturn res \n\nres is initialized with an empty list; each time through the loop, we append the next ele- \nment. So res is another kind of accumulator. \n\nAn operation like capitalize_all is sometimes called a map because it \u201cmaps\u201d a function \n(in this case the method capitalize ) onto each of the elements in a sequence. \n\nAnother common operation is to select some of the elements from a list and return a sublist. \nFor example, the following function takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains \nonly the uppercase strings: \n\ndef only_upper(t): \nres = [] \nfor s in t: \nif s.isupper(): \nres.append(s) \nreturn res \n\n94 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\nisupper is a string method that returns True if the string contains only upper case letters. \n\nAn operation like only_upper is called a \ufb01lter because it selects some of the elements and \n\ufb01lters out the others. \n\nMost common list operations can be expressed as a combination of map, \ufb01lter and reduce. \n\n10.8 \nDeleting elements \n\nThere are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element \nyou want, you can use pop : \n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> x = t.pop(1) \n>>> t \n['a', 'c'] \n>>> x \n'b' \npop modi\ufb01es the list and returns the element that was removed. If you don\u2019t provide an \nindex, it deletes and returns the last element. \n\nIf you don\u2019t need the removed value, you can use the del operator: \n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> del t[1] \n>>> t \n['a', 'c'] \nIf you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove : \n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> t.remove('b') \n>>> t \n['a', 'c'] \nThe return value from remove is None . \n\nTo remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index: \n>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] \n>>> del t[1:5] \n>>> t \n['a', 'f'] \nAs usual, the slice selects all the elements up to but not including the second index. \n\n10.9 \nLists and strings \n\nA string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence of values, but a list of characters \nis not the same as a string. To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use list : \n\n>>> s = 'spam' \n>>> t = list(s) \n>>> t \n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm'] \n\n10.10. Objects and values \n95 \n\na \n\nb \n\u2019banana\u2019 \na \n\nb \n\n\u2019banana\u2019 \n\n\u2019banana\u2019 \n\nFigure 10.2: State diagram. \n\nBecause list is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable \nname. I also avoid l because it looks too much like 1 . So that\u2019s why I use t . \n\nThe list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into \nwords, you can use the split method: \n\n>>> s = 'pining for the fjords' \n>>> t = s.split() \n>>> t \n['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords'] \n\nAn optional argument called a delimiter speci\ufb01es which characters to use as word bound- \naries. The following example uses a hyphen as a delimiter: \n\n>>> s = 'spam-spam-spam' \n>>> delimiter = '-' \n>>> t = s.split(delimiter) \n>>> t \n['spam', 'spam', 'spam'] \n\njoin is the inverse of split . It takes a list of strings and concatenates the elements. join is \na string method, so you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the list as a parameter: \n\n>>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords'] \n>>> delimiter = ' ' \n>>> s = delimiter.join(t) \n>>> s \n'pining for the fjords' \n\nIn this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words. To \nconcatenate strings without spaces, you can use the empty string, '' , as a delimiter. \n\n10.10 \nObjects and values \n\nIf we run these assignment statements: \n\na = 'banana' \nb = 'banana' \n\nWe know that a and b both refer to a string, but we don\u2019t know whether they refer to the \nsame string. There are two possible states, shown in Figure 10.2. \n\nIn one case, a and b refer to two different objects that have the same value. In the second \ncase, they refer to the same object. \n\nTo check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can use the is operator. \n\n96 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\na \n\nb \n\n[ 1, 2, 3 ] \n\n[ 1, 2, 3 ] \n\nFigure 10.3: State diagram. \n\na \n\nb \n[ 1, 2, 3 ] \n\nFigure 10.4: State diagram. \n\n>>> a = 'banana' \n>>> b = 'banana' \n>>> a is b \nTrue \n\nIn this example, Python only created one string object, and both a and b refer to it. But \nwhen you create two lists, you get two objects: \n\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> b = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> a is b \nFalse \n\nSo the state diagram looks like Figure 10.3. \n\nIn this case we would say that the two lists are equivalent , because they have the same el- \nements, but not identical , because they are not the same object. If two objects are identical, \nthey are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical. \n\nUntil now, we have been using \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d interchangeably, but it is more precise \nto say that an object has a value. If you evaluate [1, 2, 3] , you get a list object whose \nvalue is a sequence of integers. If another list has the same elements, we say it has the \nsame value, but it is not the same object. \n\n10.11 \nAliasing \n\nIf a refers to an object and you assign b = a , then both variables refer to the same object: \n\n>>> a = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> b = a \n>>> b is a \nTrue \n\nThe state diagram looks like Figure 10.4. \n\nThe association of a variable with an object is called a reference . In this example, there are \ntwo references to the same object. \n\nAn object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object \nis aliased . \n\nIf the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other: \n\n10.12. List arguments \n97 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n\u2019a\u2019 \n\n\u2019b\u2019 \n\n\u2019c\u2019 \n\nlist \n\nt \n\nletters \n\ndelete_head \n\n__main__ \n\nFigure 10.5: Stack diagram. \n\n>>> b[0] = 42 \n>>> a \n[42, 2, 3] \n\nAlthough this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid \naliasing when you are working with mutable objects. \n\nFor immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a problem. In this example: \n\na = 'banana' \nb = 'banana' \n\nIt almost never makes a difference whether a and b refer to the same string or not. \n\n10.12 \nList arguments \n\nWhen you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to the list. If the function \nmodi\ufb01es the list, the caller sees the change. For example, delete_head removes the \ufb01rst \nelement from a list: \n\ndef delete_head(t): \ndel t[0] \n\nHere\u2019s how it is used: \n\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> delete_head(letters) \n>>> letters \n['b', 'c'] \n\nThe parameter t and the variable letters are aliases for the same object. The stack diagram \nlooks like Figure 10.5. \n\nSince the list is shared by two frames, I drew it between them. \n\nIt is important to distinguish between operations that modify lists and operations that cre- \nate new lists. For example, the append method modi\ufb01es a list, but the + operator creates a \nnew list. \n\nHere\u2019s an example using append : \n\n>>> t1 = [1, 2] \n>>> t2 = t1.append(3) \n>>> t1 \n[1, 2, 3] \n>>> t2 \nNone \n\n98 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\nThe return value from append is None . \n\nHere\u2019s an example using the + operator: \n\n>>> t3 = t1 + [4] \n>>> t1 \n[1, 2, 3] \n>>> t3 \n[1, 2, 3, 4] \n\nThe result of the operator is a new list, and the original list is unchanged. \n\nThis difference is important when you write functions that are supposed to modify lists. \nFor example, this function does not delete the head of a list: \n\ndef bad_delete_head(t): \nt = t[1:] \n# WRONG! \n\nThe slice operator creates a new list and the assignment makes t refer to it, but that doesn\u2019t \naffect the caller. \n\n>>> t4 = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> bad_delete_head(t4) \n>>> t4 \n[1, 2, 3] \n\nAt the beginning of bad_delete_head , t and t4 refer to the same list. At the end, t refers \nto a new list, but t4 still refers to the original, unmodi\ufb01ed list. \n\nAn alternative is to write a function that creates and returns a new list. For example, tail \nreturns all but the \ufb01rst element of a list: \n\ndef tail(t): \nreturn t[1:] \n\nThis function leaves the original list unmodi\ufb01ed. Here\u2019s how it is used: \n\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c'] \n>>> rest = tail(letters) \n>>> rest \n['b', 'c'] \n\n10.13 \nDebugging \n\nCareless use of lists (and other mutable objects) can lead to long hours of debugging. Here \nare some common pitfalls and ways to avoid them: \n\n1. Most list methods modify the argument and return None . This is the opposite of the \nstring methods, which return a new string and leave the original alone. \n\nIf you are used to writing string code like this: \n\nword = word.strip() \n\nIt is tempting to write list code like this: \n\n10.13. Debugging \n99 \n\nt = t.sort() \n# WRONG! \n\nBecause sort returns None , the next operation you perform with t is likely to fail. \n\nBefore using list methods and operators, you should read the documentation care- \nfully and then test them in interactive mode. \n\n2. Pick an idiom and stick with it. \n\nPart of the problem with lists is that there are too many ways to do things. For exam- \nple, to remove an element from a list, you can use pop , remove , del , or even a slice \nassignment. \n\nTo add an element, you can use the append method or the + operator. Assuming that \nt is a list and x is a list element, these are correct: \n\nt.append(x) \nt = t + [x] \nt += [x] \n\nAnd these are wrong: \n\nt.append([x]) \n# WRONG! \nt = t.append(x) \n# WRONG! \nt + [x] \n# WRONG! \nt = t + x \n# WRONG! \n\nTry out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure you understand \nwhat they do. Notice that only the last one causes a runtime error; the other three are \nlegal, but they do the wrong thing. \n\n3. Make copies to avoid aliasing. \n\nIf you want to use a method like sort that modi\ufb01es the argument, but you need to \nkeep the original list as well, you can make a copy. \n\n>>> t = [3, 1, 2] \n>>> t2 = t[:] \n>>> t2.sort() \n>>> t \n[3, 1, 2] \n>>> t2 \n[1, 2, 3] \n\nIn this example you could also use the built-in function sorted , which returns a new, \nsorted list and leaves the original alone. \n\n>>> t2 = sorted(t) \n>>> t \n[3, 1, 2] \n>>> t2 \n[1, 2, 3] \n\n100 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\n10.14 \nGlossary \n\nlist: A sequence of values. \n\nelement: One of the values in a list (or other sequence), also called items. \n\nnested list: A list that is an element of another list. \n\naccumulator: A variable used in a loop to add up or accumulate a result. \n\naugmented assignment: A statement that updates the value of a variable using an opera- \ntor like += . \n\nreduce: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence and accumulates the elements into \na single result. \n\nmap: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence and performs an operation on each \nelement. \n\n\ufb01lter: A processing pattern that traverses a list and selects the elements that satisfy some \ncriterion. \n\nobject: Something a variable can refer to. An object has a type and a value. \n\nequivalent: Having the same value. \n\nidentical: Being the same object (which implies equivalence). \n\nreference: The association between a variable and its value. \n\naliasing: A circumstance where two or more variables refer to the same object. \n\ndelimiter: A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split. \n\n10.15 \nExercises \n\nYou can download solutions to these exercises from https://thinkpython.com/code/ \nlist_exercises.py . \nExercise 10.1. Write a function called nested_sum that takes a list of lists of integers and adds up \nthe elements from all of the nested lists. For example: \n\n>>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]] \n>>> nested_sum(t) \n21 \nExercise 10.2. Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and returns the cumu- \nlative sum; that is, a new list where the ith element is the sum of the \ufb01rst i + 1 elements from the \noriginal list. For example: \n\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3] \n>>> cumsum(t) \n[1, 3, 6] \nExercise 10.3. Write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that contains \nall but the \ufb01rst and last elements. For example: \n\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4] \n>>> middle(t) \n[2, 3] \n\n10.15. Exercises \n101 \n\nExercise 10.4. Write a function called chop that takes a list, modi\ufb01es it by removing the \ufb01rst and \nlast elements, and returns None . For example: \n\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4] \n>>> chop(t) \n>>> t \n[2, 3] \nExercise 10.5. Write a function called is_sorted that takes a list as a parameter and returns True \nif the list is sorted in ascending order and False otherwise. For example: \n\n>>> is_sorted([1, 2, 2]) \nTrue \n>>> is_sorted(['b', 'a']) \nFalse \nExercise 10.6. Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell the other. \nWrite a function called is_anagram that takes two strings and returns True if they are anagrams. \nExercise 10.7. Write a function called has_duplicates that takes a list and returns True if there \nis any element that appears more than once. It should not modify the original list. \nExercise 10.8. This exercise pertains to the so-called Birthday Paradox, which you can read about \nat http: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Birthday_ paradox . \n\nIf there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances that two of them have the same birthday? \nYou can estimate this probability by generating random samples of 23 birthdays and checking for \nmatches. Hint: you can generate random birthdays with the randint function in the random \nmodule. \n\nYou can download my solution from https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ birthday. py . \nExercise 10.9. Write a function that reads the \ufb01le words.txt and builds a list with one element \nper word. Write two versions of this function, one using the append method and the other using \nthe idiom t = t + [x] . Which one takes longer to run? Why? \n\nSolution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ wordlist. py . \nExercise 10.10. To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use the in operator, but it \nwould be slow because it searches through the words in order. \n\nBecause the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up with a bisection search (also \nknown as binary search), which is similar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary \n(the book, not the data structure). You start in the middle and check to see whether the word you are \nlooking for comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, you search the \ufb01rst half of the list \nthe same way. Otherwise you search the second half. \n\nEither way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the word list has 113,809 words, it will \ntake about 17 steps to \ufb01nd the word or conclude that it\u2019s not there. \n\nWrite a function called in_bisect that takes a sorted list and a target value and returns True if \nthe word is in the list and False if it\u2019s not. \n\nOr you could read the documentation of the bisect module and use that! Solution: https: \n// thinkpython. com/ code/ inlist. py . \nExercise 10.11. Two words are a \u201creverse pair\u201d if each is the reverse of the other. Write a program \nthat \ufb01nds all the reverse pairs in the word list. Solution: https: // thinkpython. com/ code/ \nreverse_ pair. py . \nExercise 10.12. Two words \u201cinterlock\u201d if taking alternating letters from each forms a new \nword. \nFor example, \u201cshoe\u201d and \u201ccold\u201d interlock to form \u201cschooled\u201d. \nSolution: https: // \n\n102 \nChapter 10. Lists \n\nthinkpython. com/ code/ interlock. py . Credit: This exercise is inspired by an example at \nhttp: // puzzlers. org . \n\n1. Write a program that \ufb01nds all pairs of words that interlock. Hint: don\u2019t enumerate all pairs! \n\n2. Can you \ufb01nd any words that are three-way interlocked; that is, every third letter forms a \nword, starting from the \ufb01rst, second or third? \n\n\n## Chapter 11\n\n\n",
