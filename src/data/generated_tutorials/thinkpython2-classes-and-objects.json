The next step is to learn \u201cobject-oriented programming\u201d, which uses programmer- de\ufb01ned types to organize both code and data. Object-oriented programming is a big topic; it will take a few chapters to get there. \n\nCode examples from this chapter are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/ Point1.py; solutions to the exercises are available from https://thinkpython.com/code/ Point1_soln.py. \n\n15.1 Programmer-de\ufb01ned types \n\nWe have used many of Python\u2019s built-in types; now we are going to de\ufb01ne a new type. As an example, we will create a type called Point that represents a point in two-dimensional space. \n\nIn mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses with a comma separating the coordinates. For example, (0, 0) represents the origin, and (x, y) represents the point x units to the right and y units up from the origin. \n\nThere are several ways we might represent points in Python: \n\n\u2022 We could store the coordinates separately in two variables, x and y. \n\n\u2022 We could store the coordinates as elements in a list or tuple. \n\n\u2022 We could create a new type to represent points as objects. \n\nCreating a new type is more complicated than the other options, but it has advantages that will be apparent soon. \n\nA programmer-de\ufb01ned type is also called a class. A class de\ufb01nition looks like this: \n\nclass Point: \"\"\"Represents a point in 2-D space.\"\"\" \n\n148 Chapter 15. Classes and objects \n\nx \n\ny \n\n3.0 \n\n4.0 \n\nblank Point \n\nFigure 15.1: Object diagram. \n\nThe header indicates that the new class is called Point. The body is a docstring that ex- plains what the class is for. You can de\ufb01ne variables and methods inside a class de\ufb01nition, but we will get back to that later. \n\nDe\ufb01ning a class named Point creates a class object. \n\n>>> Point <class '__main__.Point'> \n\nBecause Point is de\ufb01ned at the top level, its \u201cfull name\u201d is __main__.Point. \n\nThe class object is like a factory for creating objects. To create a Point, you call Point as if it were a function. \n\n>>> blank = Point() >>> blank <__main__.Point object at 0xb7e9d3ac> \n\nThe return value is a reference to a Point object, which we assign to blank. \n\nCreating a new object is called instantiation, and the object is an instance of the class. \n\nWhen you print an instance, Python tells you what class it belongs to and where it is stored in memory (the pre\ufb01x 0x means that the following number is in hexadecimal). \n\nEvery object is an instance of some class, so \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cinstance\u201d are interchangeable. But in this chapter I use \u201cinstance\u201d to indicate that I am talking about a programmer- de\ufb01ned type. \n\n15.2 Attributes \n\nYou can assign values to an instance using dot notation: \n\n>>> blank.x = 3.0 >>> blank.y = 4.0 \n\nThis syntax is similar to the syntax for selecting a variable from a module, such as math.pi or string.whitespace. In this case, though, we are assigning values to named elements of an object. These elements are called attributes. \n\nAs a noun, \u201cAT-trib-ute\u201d is pronounced with emphasis on the \ufb01rst syllable, as opposed to \u201ca-TRIB-ute\u201d, which is a verb. \n\nFigure 15.1 is a state diagram that shows the result of these assignments. A state diagram that shows an object and its attributes is called an object diagram. \n\nThe variable blank refers to a Point object, which contains two attributes. Each attribute refers to a \ufb02oating-point number. \n\nYou can read the value of an attribute using the same syntax: \n\n15.3. Rectangles 149 \n\n>>> blank.y 4.0 >>> x = blank.x >>> x 3.0 \n\nThe expression blank.x means, \u201cGo to the object blank refers to and get the value of x.\u201d In the example, we assign that value to a variable named x. There is no con\ufb02ict between the variable x and the attribute x. \n\nYou can use dot notation as part of any expression. For example: \n\n>>> '(%g, %g)' % (blank.x, blank.y) '(3.0, 4.0)' >>> distance = math.sqrt(blank.x**2 + blank.y**2) >>> distance 5.0 \n\nYou can pass an instance as an argument in the usual way. For example: \n\ndef print_point(p): print('(%g, %g)' % (p.x, p.y)) \n\nprint_point takes a point as an argument and displays it in mathematical notation. To invoke it, you can pass blank as an argument: \n\n>>> print_point(blank) (3.0, 4.0) \n\nInside the function, p is an alias for blank, so if the function modi\ufb01es p, blank changes. \n\nAs an exercise, write a function called distance_between_points that takes two Points as arguments and returns the distance between them. \n\n15.3 Rectangles \n\nSometimes it is obvious what the attributes of an object should be, but other times you have to make decisions. For example, imagine you are designing a class to represent rectangles. What attributes would you use to specify the location and size of a rectangle? You can ig- nore angle; to keep things simple, assume that the rectangle is either vertical or horizontal. \n\nThere are at least two possibilities: \n\n\u2022 You could specify one corner of the rectangle (or the center), the width, and the height. \n\n\u2022 You could specify two opposing corners. \n\nAt this point it is hard to say whether either is better than the other, so we\u2019ll implement the \ufb01rst one, just as an example. \n\nHere is the class de\ufb01nition: \n\n150 Chapter 15. Classes and objects \n\ny \n\n0.0 x \n\n0.0 \n\nwidth 100.0 \n\ncorner \n\n200.0 Point \n\nRectangle \n\nbox \n\nheight \n\nFigure 15.2: Object diagram. \n\nclass Rectangle: \"\"\"Represents a rectangle. \n\nattributes: width, height, corner. \"\"\" \n\nThe docstring lists the attributes: width and height are numbers; corner is a Point object that speci\ufb01es the lower-left corner. \n\nTo represent a rectangle, you have to instantiate a Rectangle object and assign values to the attributes: \n\nbox = Rectangle() box.width = 100.0 box.height = 200.0 box.corner = Point() box.corner.x = 0.0 box.corner.y = 0.0 \n\nThe expression box.corner.x means, \u201cGo to the object box refers to and select the attribute named corner; then go to that object and select the attribute named x.\u201d \n\nFigure 15.2 shows the state of this object. An object that is an attribute of another object is embedded. \n\n15.4 Instances as return values \n\nFunctions can return instances. For example, find_center takes a Rectangle as an argu- ment and returns a Point that contains the coordinates of the center of the Rectangle: \n\ndef find_center(rect): p = Point() p.x = rect.corner.x + rect.width/2 p.y = rect.corner.y + rect.height/2 return p \n\nHere is an example that passes box as an argument and assigns the resulting Point to center: \n\n>>> center = find_center(box) >>> print_point(center) (50, 100) \n\n15.5. Objects are mutable 151 \n\n15.5 Objects are mutable \n\nYou can change the state of an object by making an assignment to one of its attributes. For example, to change the size of a rectangle without changing its position, you can modify the values of width and height: \n\nbox.width = box.width + 50 box.height = box.height + 100 \n\nYou can also write functions that modify objects. For example, grow_rectangle takes a Rectangle object and two numbers, dwidth and dheight, and adds the numbers to the width and height of the rectangle: \n\ndef grow_rectangle(rect, dwidth, dheight): rect.width += dwidth rect.height += dheight \n\nHere is an example that demonstrates the effect: \n\n>>> box.width, box.height (150.0, 300.0) >>> grow_rectangle(box, 50, 100) >>> box.width, box.height (200.0, 400.0) \n\nInside the function, rect is an alias for box, so when the function modi\ufb01es rect, box changes. \n\nAs an exercise, write a function named move_rectangle that takes a Rectangle and two numbers named dx and dy. It should change the location of the rectangle by adding dx to the x coordinate of corner and adding dy to the y coordinate of corner. \n\n15.6 Copying \n\nAliasing can make a program dif\ufb01cult to read because changes in one place might have unexpected effects in another place. It is hard to keep track of all the variables that might refer to a given object. \n\nCopying an object is often an alternative to aliasing. The copy module contains a function called copy that can duplicate any object: \n\n>>> p1 = Point() >>> p1.x = 3.0 >>> p1.y = 4.0 \n\n>>> import copy >>> p2 = copy.copy(p1) \n\np1 and p2 contain the same data, but they are not the same Point. \n\n>>> print_point(p1) (3, 4) >>> print_point(p2) (3, 4) >>> p1 is p2 False \n\n152 Chapter 15. Classes and objects \n\ny \n\n0.0 x \n\n0.0 \n\nwidth \n\nheight \n\n100.0 \n\ncorner \n\n200.0 \n\nbox 100.0 \n\n200.0 \n\nwidth \n\nheight \n\ncorner \n\nbox2 \n\nFigure 15.3: Object diagram. \n\n>>> p1 == p2 False \n\nThe is operator indicates that p1 and p2 are not the same object, which is what we ex- pected. But you might have expected == to yield True because these points contain the same data. In that case, you will be disappointed to learn that for instances, the default behavior of the == operator is the same as the is operator; it checks object identity, not object equivalence. That\u2019s because for programmer-de\ufb01ned types, Python doesn\u2019t know what should be considered equivalent. At least, not yet. \n\nIf you use copy.copy to duplicate a Rectangle, you will \ufb01nd that it copies the Rectangle object but not the embedded Point. \n\n>>> box2 = copy.copy(box) >>> box2 is box False >>> box2.corner is box.corner True \n\nFigure 15.3 shows what the object diagram looks like. This operation is called a shallow copy because it copies the object and any references it contains, but not the embedded objects. \n\nFor most applications, this is not what you want. In this example, invoking grow_rectangle on one of the Rectangles would not affect the other, but invoking move_rectangle on either would affect both! This behavior is confusing and error-prone. \n\nFortunately, the copy module provides a method named deepcopy that copies not only the object but also the objects it refers to, and the objects they refer to, and so on. You will not be surprised to learn that this operation is called a deep copy. \n\n>>> box3 = copy.deepcopy(box) >>> box3 is box False >>> box3.corner is box.corner False \n\nbox3 and box are completely separate objects. \n\nAs an exercise, write a version of move_rectangle that creates and returns a new Rectangle instead of modifying the old one. \n\n15.7 Debugging \n\nWhen you start working with objects, you are likely to encounter some new exceptions. If you try to access an attribute that doesn\u2019t exist, you get an AttributeError: \n\n15.8. Glossary 153 \n\n>>> p = Point() >>> p.x = 3 >>> p.y = 4 >>> p.z AttributeError: Point instance has no attribute 'z' If you are not sure what type an object is, you can ask: >>> type(p) <class '__main__.Point'> You can also use isinstance to check whether an object is an instance of a class: >>> isinstance(p, Point) True If you are not sure whether an object has a particular attribute, you can use the built-in function hasattr: >>> hasattr(p, 'x') True >>> hasattr(p, 'z') False The \ufb01rst argument can be any object; the second argument is a string that contains the name of the attribute. \n\nYou can also use a try statement to see if the object has the attributes you need: try: x = p.x except AttributeError: x = 0 This approach can make it easier to write functions that work with different types; more on that topic is coming up in Section 17.9. \n\n15.8 Glossary \n\nclass: A programmer-de\ufb01ned type.
