I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low. \n\nOne of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces. \n\nTwo weeks before the \ufb01rst day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were: \n\n\u2022 Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages. \n\n\u2022 Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and de\ufb01ne each term at \ufb01rst use. \n\n\u2022 Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most dif\ufb01cult topics and split them into a series of small steps. \n\n\u2022 Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest. \n\nI needed a title, so on a whim I chose How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. \n\nMy \ufb01rst version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice. \n\nI released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book. \n\nWhat happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the \ufb01rst Python version in 2001. \n\nIn 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the \ufb01rst time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun. \n\nvi Chapter 0. Preface \n\nSince then I\u2019ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. \n\nThe result is this book, now with the less grandiose title Think Python. Some of the changes are: \n\n\u2022 I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These sections present general techniques for \ufb01nding and avoiding bugs, and warnings about Python pit- falls. \n\n\u2022 I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to a few substantial projects. Most exercises include a link to my solution. \n\n\u2022 I added a series of case studies\u2014longer examples with exercises, solutions, and dis- cussion. \n\n\u2022 I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic design patterns. \n\n\u2022 I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms. \n\nThe second edition of Think Python has these new features: \n\n\u2022 The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python 3. \n\n\u2022 I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help beginners get started running Python in a browser, so you don\u2019t have to deal with installing Python until you want to. \n\n\u2022 For Chapter 4.1 I switched from my own turtle graphics package, called Swampy, to a more standard Python module, turtle, which is easier to install and more powerful. \n\n\u2022 I added a new chapter called \u201cThe Goodies\u201d, which introduces some additional Python features that are not strictly necessary, but sometimes handy. \n\nI hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think like a computer scientist, at least a little bit. \n\nAllen B. Downey \n\nOlin College \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nMany thanks to Jeff Elkner, who translated my Java book into Python, which got this project started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my favorite language. \n\nThanks also to Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to How to Think Like a Com- puter Scientist. \n\nThanks to the Free Software Foundation for developing the GNU Free Documentation Li- cense, which helped make my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible, and Creative Commons for the license I am using now. \n\nvii \n\nThanks to the editors at Lulu who worked on How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. \n\nThanks to the editors at O\u2019Reilly Media who worked on Think Python. \n\nThanks to all the students who worked with earlier versions of this book and all the con- tributors (listed below) who sent in corrections and suggestions. \n\nContributor List \n\nMore than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in suggestions and corrections over the past few years. Their contributions, and enthusiasm for this project, have been a huge help. \n\nIf you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to feedback@thinkpython.com. If I make a change based on your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to be omitted). \n\nIf you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are \ufb01ne, too, but not quite as easy to work with.
