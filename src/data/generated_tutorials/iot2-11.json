Sections 1.1.3, and 1.5.2 and 7.6 described Internet-connected RFIDs for logistics, \ntracking, inventory control, sales, security, supply-chain management and many applications. \n\nSections 1.5.3 and 7.7.6 dealt with applications of Internet connected complex extensively \ninterconnected WSNs. Section 1.6.1 discussed about M2M communication in extensively \ninterconnected and Internet-connected M2M applications and services, such as coordinated \nmovement of tools, robots, drones, refinery operations, and sequential control of machines. \n\nApplications of IoT architecture and Internet of ATMs for generating income from transaction \ncharges, charges for advertisements at the machine locations, and idle-state advertisements of \nbank products and bank services at the display screen were discussed in Examples 2.3 and 5.8. \nInternet-connected chain of Automatic Chocolate Vending Machines (ACVMs) with associated \nbusiness activities such as displaying advertisements for chocolates, news, weather reports and \nevents in the city whenever not in use, and ACVM supply chain maintenance services and new \nbusiness activities using predictive analytics were dealt with in Examples 5.1, 5.5, 5.9 and 6.6. \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n427 \n\nExamples 5.2 and 5.7 discussed Internet-connected automobile for automotive service centre \nmaintenance and timely servicing or replacements of the components, with minimum number \nof visits to the service centre using predictive analytics. \n\nSection 5.4 discussed business intelligence, business processes and distributed business- \nprocesses having wide applications, such as in automotive maintenance applications/services. \n\nSection 7.3 discussed IIoT (Industrial IoT) applications in manufacturing, maintenance and \nindustry. IIoT enables the integration of complex physical machinery, industry and business. \n\nExample 7.8 explained applications of IIoT technologies in optimising the processes for \nbicycle manufacturing. \n\nExample 7.9. explained IIoT applications for railroad service centre using Internet-connected \nsensors on the rails and predictive analytics. \n\n11.1 \nINTRODUCTION \n\nIoT has many applications in different domains such as applications/services of RFIDs in \nlogistics, WSNs, predictive maintenance of railroads, oil pipelines, monitoring of transport \nunits in logistics, detecting machine faults in industry, and deploying these IoT based \napplications and services. Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm which will enable intelligent \nconnected manufacturing and will focus on uses of interconnected IoT and IIoT. \n\nBusiness is driving force for growth of industry and technologies. This chapter focuses \non design of business models, need of innovation in a model, value propositions in a \nmodel and value creation using a model with reference to IoT and IIoT. \n\nFollowing are the lessons learnt earlier and new key terms, which require understanding \nfor learning business model design, innovation and value creation in business processes. \n\nApplication or App means software for application, such as software for creating and \nsending an SMS, measuring and sending the measured data, or receiving message from a \nspecified sender. Application means application software. App is the abbreviation popular \nfor application in the device whenever only one specific task is executed following user \ninteraction(s). \n\nService means a mechanism, which enables the provisioning of access to one or more \ncapabilities. An interface for a service provides the access to the capabilities. The access \nto each capability is consistent with the constraints and policies, specified by a service \ndescription . \n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) is a process that enables a business service to extract new facts and \nknowledge, and then undertake better decisions. The new facts and knowledge follow \nfrom the earlier results of data processing, aggregation and then analysing those results. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p454_i0.png)\n428 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nBusiness process (BP) is an activity or series of activities or a collection of inter-related \nstructured activities, tasks or processes. A BP serves a particular goal or specific result or \nservice or product. The BP is a representation or process matrix or flowchart of a sequence \nof activities with interleaving decision points (Section 5.1). \n\nDistributed BP (DBP) is a collection of logically interrelated business processes. DBP \nreduces the complexity and communication costs, and enables faster responses and \nsmaller processing load at the central BP system. DBP is similar to the distribution of \ncontrol processes for each group of lights at the gateway itself with reduced complexity, \ncommunication costs, faster responses and smaller processing load at the central system \nof lighting control (Example 1.2). \n\nDBP management is management of DBPs in an enterprise network. \n\nBPs integration is integration of BPs to reduce the complexity and communication costs, \nand enable faster responses and smaller processing load at the central BP system (for \nexample in an enterprise system). \n\nIndustry 4.0 can be defined in several ways as: \n\n\u25cf Industry 4.0 refers to a collective term embracing a number of contemporary \nautomation, data exchange and manufacturing technologies. 1 \n\n\u25cf Industry 4.0 is the vision of tomorrow\u2019s manufacturing deploying intelligent factories, \nmachines, raw materials, and products in which the Internet plays a vital role. 2 \n\n\u25cf Industry 4.0 is the \u2018fourth industrial revolution\u2019 with use of Cyber Physical Production \nSystem (CPPS), which is a merger of virtual and real world. 3 \n\n\u25cf Industry 4.0 is the intelligent solution for connected manufacturing. 4 \n\nFollowing sections describe the business models and processes when using IoT. Section \n11.2 describes business models and business-model innovation; Section 11.3 describes \nvalue creation and Section 11.4 describes business model scenario for IoT. \n\n11.2 \nBUSINESS MODELS AND BUSINESS \nMODEL INNOVATION \n\nBusiness model is a concept in business. Following subsections \ndescribe the concepts of business models and business model \ninnovation in business processes. \n\n1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0 \n2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRURtORnis \n3 www.deloitte.com/.../ch-en-manufacturing-industry-4-0-24102014.pdf \n4 https://www.bosch-si.com/solutions/manufacturing/industry-4-0/industry-4-0.html) \n\nOutline the \nbuilding blocks \nneeded for a business \nmodel and understand \n\nthe importance of \n\ninnovation in the \n\nbusiness model \n\nLO 11.1 \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n429 \n\n11.2.1 \nBusiness Models \n\nBusiness models continue to grow and innovate since ancient \ntimes. Ancient time models were \u2018barter resource with one \nanother. Later models were purchase, add value and sale, and \nuse of currency, \u2018plan, purchase raw material, manufacture a \nproduct on bigger scale, distribute and sale and profit\u2019, and the \ninnovations still continue. A business model nowadays takes into \naccount many factors, such as competitive advantage, experience \ncurves, value chain, theory of portfolio of products and services, core competencies of \nbusiness organisation and generic strategies. Portfolio means mix of two or more products \nor services. For example, producing watches and jewellery studded watches of simple to \nsophisticated designs. Another example is offering predictive analytics for automobile \nservice centres as well as oil pipelines. \n\nSeveral definitions and descriptions of \u2018business model\u2019 exist in literature. A business \nmodel can be defined as a conceptual structure supporting the viability of a business, \nincluding its purpose, its goals and its ongoing plans for achieving them. 5 \n\nA business model can be defined as abstract representation of an organisation and \nthis representation may be conceptual, textual, and/or graphical. Representation is for \nthe all the core inter-related architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements. \nArchitecture includes organisational infrastructure and technological architecture. \nRepresentation includes many activities of present and future, and core products and/or \nservices the organisation offers, or will offer. \n\nThe term \u2019business model\u2019 refers to \u2018uses of a range of informal and formal descriptions \nto represent core aspects of a business, business process, strategy, practices and operational \nprocesses and policies including culture. \n\nA business model may focus not only on financial goals but also on the business \nsustainability or establishing a corporate culture when offering value to customers. \n\nWorking on a Business Model \n\nDocumentation for a business model has many benefits, such as \nmaintaining a focus on corporate goals and reviewing operational \npractices. A popular way of generating or working on a business \nmodel is using a canvas which is a visual template for developing \nnew or documenting existing business model. The canvas was \ndesigned and developed by Alexander Osterwalder 6 and his \nco-workers. The canvas is a single reference model. Its basis is \nconceptualisation similarities of a wide range of business models. \n\nA business model is \n\nan abstraction for a \nrange of informal and \nformal descriptions to \nrepresent core aspects \n\nof a business \n\nBusiness model canvas \n\nis a visual chart with a \n\nnumber of elements, \nwhich describe building \n\nblocks of a company \n\nbusiness \n\n5 http://www.whatis.techtarget.com%20business%20model/ \n\n6 A. Osterwalder, Y. Pigneur, A. Smith et al., \u201c Business Model Generation \u201d, Wiley, 2010 \n\n430 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA \u2018Business Model Canvas\u2019 is a visual chart with elements. The elements describe the \ncompanies or organisations product\u2019s value proposition, infrastructure, customers and \nfinances. Figure 11.1 shows nine building blocks of this canvas. \n\nKey \nActivities \nKey \nPartners \n\nCost Structure \n\nKey \nResources \n\nCustomer \nRelationships \nValue Propositions \n\nChannels \n\nRevenue \n\nStreams \n\nCustomer \nSegments \n\nDesign For \nDesign By \nDay    Month    Year \n\nCanvas No\u2026\u2026\u2026. \n\nFigure 11.1 \nNine building blocks of a business model canvas \n\nOsterwalder Business Model Canvas has nine business model building blocks. Three building \nblocks are for business infrastructure which consist of: \n\n1. Key partners: Strategic alliances between competitors or non-competitors to optimise \n\nthe operations and reduce risks of a business model \n2. Key activities: Key activities to execute a company\u2019s value proposition \n3. Key resources: Key resources for sustaining and supporting the business, and \n\nnecessary for creation of value to customers. Examples of resources are financial, \nphysical, human and intellectual, customer segments, platforms, markets and \ndiversifications of innovative products. \nFour building blocks are business offerings which consist of: \n\n1. Value propositions: Products and services offered, their features such as performance, \n\nefficiency, accessibility, price, cost, convenience, usability and design, and how they \ndiffer from competitors fall in this category \n2. Customer relationships: Identified type of relationship of the company to be created \n\nwith their customers and targeted segments \n3. Customer segments: Identified sets of customers, segments, client groups and diverse \n\ngroups based on the value propositions offered \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n431 \n\n4. Channels: Effective, fast, efficient and cost-effective channels to deliver value \n\nproposition to its targeted customers \nTwo building blocks are for business finances which consist of: \n\n1. Cost structure: Cost constituents, such as the input raw material, manufacturing, \n\nmaintenance, packaging, logistics, machinery replacement, to be considered in \noffering the value propositions and services, and considerations of scopes of \neconomies in the operations \n2. Revenue stream: Identified types of income sources, such as income from sales of \n\nproduct and physical goods, usage charges for the services, charges for subscription, \nsales income, service usage charges, subscription charges, relationship of the \ncompany to be created with their customers and targeted segments \n\nCanvas Format \n\nTwo canvas formats are: \n\n1. Large surface printed sheet to enable sketching, creativity, analysis, understanding \n\nor discussion on business model elements \n2. Web-based interface for canvas where the entries of elements can be made and \n\ncreative suggestions can be placed, understanding can be obtained, analysis can be \ndone or discussion on business model elements can be done. \n\nExample 11.1 \n\nProblem \nA business model canvas for services: Suggest a business model canvas for a bank for offering banking \nservices using Internet of ATMs. \n\nSolution \n\nFigure 11.2 shows nine building blocks of the canvas. \n\nNotes: \n\n1. Bank company is mutually dependent partner for ATM manufacturing, installation, maintenance and \n\nservices. Reason is that bank services to customers crucially depend on their products and services, \nand the company has a business model, which depends on the bank and bank customers. \n2. Model can be modified when bank enters into strategic partnerships with other banks to serve the \n\nother banks\u2019 customers as well. \n\nSubscription Business Model \n\nOne business model is subscription business model. A customer pays for accessing \nthe service or product at periodic intervals. For example, Internet data services, cloud \nplatform services, data centre services etc. The customers can also make members who \npay the membership fees for an organisation offering the services.

Each customer pays for customisation \nof a product/service. The customers can also make payment once or in part once and \nlater, after product usage training and further improvement costs. Example 11.3 show a \ncustomised business model. \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n433 \n\nExample 11.3 \n\nProblem \nSuggest a customised business-model canvas for Internet-based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance \nscheduling. \n\nSolution \n\nFigure 11.4 shows nine building blocks of the canvas for customised Internet-based railroad predictive \nanalytics and maintenance scheduling. \n\n11.2.2 \nBusiness Model Innovation \n\nBusiness model innovation is the development of new and unique concepts supporting \nan organization\u2019s financial viability, including its mission, and the processes for bringing \nthose concepts to fruition. The primary goal of business model innovation is to realise \nnew revenue sources by improving product value, and how the products are delivered to \ncustomers. 7 \n\nFigure 11.3 Subscription business model canvas for offering Internet of streetlight services using \n\nInternet of Streetlights and control of operations with minimum electricity use \n\nKey Activities \nControlling of operations of \nStreetlights with minimum \nelectricity usages \n\nKey \nPartners \n\nStreetlights \nService \n\nCost Structure \n\nTurnkey installation, Operations and \nmaintenances for streetlights, installations, \nGateway servers and Central server \n\nKey Resources \n\n(a) Sensors data for surrounding light \n\nintensity and traffic presence and density, \nstreetlight functioning status, (b) Internet of \nStreetlights services and control software, \n(c) 24\u00d77 Internet, Gateway, Servers, \n(d) Cloud or data centre maintenance service \n\nCustomer \nRelationships \nCompany \nReputation for \nefficient and \nreliable services \n\nValue \nProposition \nEnergy Efficient \nControl and \nEfficient 24\u00d7 7 \nServices for \nStreetlights, \nInstallation s, \nGateway Servers \nand Central \nServer \n\nChannels \n\nNone \n\nRevenue Streams \n\nAnnual subscription of municipal corporation, \nSubscription from traffic signalling and control service, and \n\nSubscriptions of advertisers on streetlight \n\ninstallations \n\nCustomer \nSegment \nSmart city \nservices \ncompany or \nMunicipal \ncorporation \n\nDesign For \nInternet of Streetlights \nService \n\nDesign By \n\nIoT Products \nDesign Company \n\nDay dd \nMonth mm Year yy \n\nCanvas No xxxxxxx. \n\n7 http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/business-innovation \n\n434 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA business model needs innovation because: \n\n\u25cf New access path to businesses and direct interaction with the customers have come \ninto existence. The access has become fast and easy. New communication channels are \nnow fast due to use of Internet, more powerful with low cost of computers, mobile \ncommunication and cloud computing. \n\n\u25cf Direct interactions at lower costs require modifications in marketing channels deployed \nearlier to reach customers. Customers also have faster and multichannel information \naccess and better search options. \n\n\u25cf Business transactions have become easier and partly automated. Information about \ncustomers has become a valuable asset. \n\n\u25cf New price models need to be worked out in new competitive environment with wider \nuse of ICT. \n\n\u25cf Decentralised models with the customer at the centre stage are building up and therefore, \nbusiness models have to be customer-centric. The model should have flexible value \nchain which reacts fast according to varying customer requirements. \n\n\u25cf Faster introduction of new products and new portfolio strategies due to better search options \nwith the customers \nBusiness models of an earlier era had innovation as an interaction dimension. This has \nshifted to the creation dimension. \n\nFigure 11.4 Canvas for Business model of Customisation offering Internet based railroad predictive \n\nanalytics and maintenance scheduling \n\nKey Activities \nSensing using network of \nultrasonic sensors for \nrailroad bed faults \ndetection, Predictive \nanalytics, Scheduling of \nmaintenances \n\nKey Partners \n\nRailroad \nmaintenance \nservice \n\nCost Structure \nTurnkey installation, Operations and maintenances for sensors \ninstallations, Gateway servers, Central server, Software \ndevelopment and maintenance \n\nValue Proposition \nCustomised Reliability for 24\u00d7 \n7 sensing of railroads, and \nmaintaining the sensors \nnetworks, Gateway servers, \nCentral server and \noperations \n\nChannels \nNone \n\nDa y dd \nMon th mm Year yy \n\nCanvas No xxxxxxx. \n\nDesign For \nInternet based railroad predictive \nanalytics and maintenance scheduling \n\nDesign By \nIIoT Products \nDesign Company \n\nKey Resources \nUltrasonic sensors network, Internet, Descriptive \nprescriptive and predictive analytics software \n\nCustomer \nRelation- \nships \nEfficient and \nreliable \nServices \n\nCustomer \nSegment \nRailways \nmaintenance \nservice \n\nRevenue Streams \nCustomisation fee and annual \nfees for software and hardware \nmaintenance \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n435 \n\nBusiness model innovation is becoming a decisive factor for successful business. Five \ninnovation drivers (Capgemini Consulting) are: \n\n1. Customer neighbourhood production units for fast deliveries and local sales, and \n\ncustomer involvement from the beginning \n2. Revenues from new sales instead of maintenance \n3. Decentralised production and service \n4. Client contribution, open-source design and procurement \n5. Significantly reduced capital expenditure \nExample 11.4 shows use of IoT leading to business-model innovation. \n\nExample 11.4 \n\nProblem \nHow does use of IoT lead to business model innovation for railroad analytics and maintenance? \n\nSolution \nFigure 11.4 showed Internet-based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance scheduling. This example \nshows a business model innovation with uses of IoT, data analytics and visualisation technologies. Key \nresources of new business models are uses of an ultrasonic sensors network, Internet, software for descriptive, \nprescriptive and predictive analytics and visualisation using dices and slices. \n\nEarlier, a business model consisted of unautomated collection of sensors data, no use of Internet, and some \nuse of descriptive analysis of collected data, and analysis of previously observed fault-intervals to design \nmaintenance schedules. \n\nNew business model innovation marks a shift to the creation dimension by use of key resources shown in \nthe figure. The use of new technologies and communication channels provide fast real-time sensors network, \ndata collection and analytics. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf A\u00a0business model\u00a0is a concept which can be defined in a number of ways. A web source defines a \nbusiness model as an abstract representation of an organisation. Representation may be conceptual, \ntextual, and/or graphical. Representation is for all core inter-related architectural, co-operational, \nand financial arrangements. Architecture includes organisational infrastructure and technological \narchitecture. Representation includes many activities of present and future. Representation includes \ncore products and/or services the organisation offers or will offer in future. \n\n\u25cf Alexander Osterwalder and his co-workers\u2019 business model canvas is a popular way of generating or \nworking on a business model. It can be  used as a visual template for developing new or documenting \nexisting business model. The canvas is a visual chart of nine building blocks\u2014key partners, key \nactivities, key resources, value propositions, and customer relationships: customer segments, \nchannels that deliver value proposition to its targeted customers cost structure and revenue stream. \n\n\u25cf Examples of business model canvas: Internet of Streetlights and Internet-based railroad sensing and \npredictive-analytics-based maintenance scheduling. \n\n\u25cf Business model innovation is the development of new, unique concepts supporting an organisation\u2019s \nfinancial viability, including its mission, and the processes for bringing those concepts to fruition. \n\n\u25cf Business model innovation must in the new era shift from the interaction dimension to the creation \ndimension. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p462_i0.png)\n436 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

For example, using RFIDs in tracking \nservice for the goods is a value proposition. Value creation means creation of a \u2018smart \ntracking and logistics service\u2019 from the sensed IDs of the RFIDs communication on \nInternet, data analytics, data visualisations and mobile communication for provisions for \nSMS to receiver and delivery confirmation to the sender. 8 \n\nValue creation is the expansion of relationships enabled by a disruptor media (Internet) \nand the creation of new behaviours as a result. \n\nValue creation is the heart of any business model. It involves performing activities \nthat enhance the value of a company\u2019s product or service (offering) and encourages customer \nwillingness to pay. \n\nFeatures of value creation using IoT are: \n\n\u25cf IoT enables addressing the emergent needs and real-time needs using predictive \nanalytics. \n\nSummarise value \n\npropositions and \n\nvalue creation \n\nusing IoT \n\nLO 11.2 \n\nNote: \n\u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \n\n\u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\n8 https://hbr.org/2014/07/how-the-internet-of-things-changes-business-models \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT \n437 \n\n\u25cf Information convergence creates new experiences for current products. Information \nenables innovative services. \n\n\u25cf IoT enables offering of product and services which can be updated using the Internet \n(such through as Wi-Fi) and create synergic value for the product. \n\n\u25cf IoT enables value capture and thus recurrent revenue. \n\n\u25cf Adds personalisation and context, and uses networked products/services. \n\n\u25cf Faster ecosystem functioning where multiple companies establish loose relationships \namong themselves or establish relationships with big companies. \n\nValue chain means series of actions for value creation. The base of IoT value chain is \ndata collected using APIs for the sensors/sensor networks/M2M data or from multiple \ninformation sources. The chain includes actions using web APIs, open data, data from \nmobile-services network and corporate databases. \n\nFigure 11.5 (a) shows value proposition in production/manufacture-driven value chain \nFigure 11.5 (b) shows value creation on deploying a value chain using information-driven \nIoT value chain in production/manufacture/service.

The key resources in the model are \nsmart streetlights, sensors network data for surrounding light intensity and traffic presence and density, \nstreetlight functioning status. Traffic presence and density data enable switching off the light in no traffic \ncondition in the vicinity. \nThe sensor network data expands the relationships to traffic signalling and control service in the city. The \nrelationship creates a new behaviour. Traffic signalling links with the data network. Traffic signalling and \ncontrol service, control the signalling systems at pathway junctions in the city. The service also generates \ntraffic density reports for GPS navigation and driving in the city. \n\nThe subscriptions from the linked services generate additional revenue to the streetlights service company. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Value creation is the expansion of relationships enabled by a disruptor media (Internet) and the \ncreation of new behaviours as a result. \n\n\u25cf Value creation involves performing activities that enhance the value of a company\u2019s product or service \n(offering) and encourages customer willingness to pay. \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.
