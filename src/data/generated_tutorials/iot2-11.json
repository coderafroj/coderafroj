Sections 1.1.3, and 1.5.2 and 7.6 described Internet-connected RFIDs for logistics, tracking, inventory control, sales, security, supply-chain management and many applications. \n\nSections 1.5.3 and 7.7.6 dealt with applications of Internet connected complex extensively interconnected WSNs. Section 1.6.1 discussed about M2M communication in extensively interconnected and Internet-connected M2M applications and services, such as coordinated movement of tools, robots, drones, refinery operations, and sequential control of machines. \n\nApplications of IoT architecture and Internet of ATMs for generating income from transaction charges, charges for advertisements at the machine locations, and idle-state advertisements of bank products and bank services at the display screen were discussed in Examples 2.3 and 5.8. Internet-connected chain of Automatic Chocolate Vending Machines (ACVMs) with associated business activities such as displaying advertisements for chocolates, news, weather reports and events in the city whenever not in use, and ACVM supply chain maintenance services and new business activities using predictive analytics were dealt with in Examples 5.1, 5.5, 5.9 and 6.6. \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 427 \n\nExamples 5.2 and 5.7 discussed Internet-connected automobile for automotive service centre maintenance and timely servicing or replacements of the components, with minimum number of visits to the service centre using predictive analytics. \n\nSection 5.4 discussed business intelligence, business processes and distributed business- processes having wide applications, such as in automotive maintenance applications/services. \n\nSection 7.3 discussed IIoT (Industrial IoT) applications in manufacturing, maintenance and industry. IIoT enables the integration of complex physical machinery, industry and business. \n\nExample 7.8 explained applications of IIoT technologies in optimising the processes for bicycle manufacturing. \n\nExample 7.9. explained IIoT applications for railroad service centre using Internet-connected sensors on the rails and predictive analytics. \n\n11.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nIoT has many applications in different domains such as applications/services of RFIDs in logistics, WSNs, predictive maintenance of railroads, oil pipelines, monitoring of transport units in logistics, detecting machine faults in industry, and deploying these IoT based applications and services. Industry 4.0 is a new paradigm which will enable intelligent connected manufacturing and will focus on uses of interconnected IoT and IIoT. \n\nBusiness is driving force for growth of industry and technologies. This chapter focuses on design of business models, need of innovation in a model, value propositions in a model and value creation using a model with reference to IoT and IIoT. \n\nFollowing are the lessons learnt earlier and new key terms, which require understanding for learning business model design, innovation and value creation in business processes. \n\nApplication or App means software for application, such as software for creating and sending an SMS, measuring and sending the measured data, or receiving message from a specified sender. Application means application software. App is the abbreviation popular for application in the device whenever only one specific task is executed following user interaction(s). \n\nService means a mechanism, which enables the provisioning of access to one or more capabilities. An interface for a service provides the access to the capabilities. The access to each capability is consistent with the constraints and policies, specified by a service description. \n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) is a process that enables a business service to extract new facts and knowledge, and then undertake better decisions. The new facts and knowledge follow from the earlier results of data processing, aggregation and then analysing those results. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p454_i0.png)\n\n428 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nBusiness process (BP) is an activity or series of activities or a collection of inter-related structured activities, tasks or processes. A BP serves a particular goal or specific result or service or product. The BP is a representation or process matrix or flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points (Section 5.1). \n\nDistributed BP (DBP) is a collection of logically interrelated business processes. DBP reduces the complexity and communication costs, and enables faster responses and smaller processing load at the central BP system. DBP is similar to the distribution of control processes for each group of lights at the gateway itself with reduced complexity, communication costs, faster responses and smaller processing load at the central system of lighting control (Example 1.2). \n\nDBP management is management of DBPs in an enterprise network. \n\nBPs integration is integration of BPs to reduce the complexity and communication costs, and enable faster responses and smaller processing load at the central BP system (for example in an enterprise system). \n\nIndustry 4.0 can be defined in several ways as: \n\n\u25cfIndustry 4.0 refers to a collective term embracing a number of contemporary automation, data exchange and manufacturing technologies.1 \n\n\u25cfIndustry 4.0 is the vision of tomorrow\u2019s manufacturing deploying intelligent factories, machines, raw materials, and products in which the Internet plays a vital role.2 \n\n\u25cfIndustry 4.0 is the \u2018fourth industrial revolution\u2019 with use of Cyber Physical Production System (CPPS), which is a merger of virtual and real world.3 \n\n\u25cfIndustry 4.0 is the intelligent solution for connected manufacturing.4 \n\nFollowing sections describe the business models and processes when using IoT. Section 11.2 describes business models and business-model innovation; Section 11.3 describes value creation and Section 11.4 describes business model scenario for IoT. \n\n11.2 BUSINESS MODELS AND BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION \n\nBusiness model is a concept in business. Following subsections describe the concepts of business models and business model innovation in business processes. \n\n1 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPRURtORnis 3 www.deloitte.com/.../ch-en-manufacturing-industry-4-0-24102014.pdf 4 https://www.bosch-si.com/solutions/manufacturing/industry-4-0/industry-4-0.html) \n\nOutline the building blocks needed for a business model and understand \n\nthe importance of \n\ninnovation in the \n\nbusiness model \n\nLO 11.1 \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 429 \n\n11.2.1 Business Models \n\nBusiness models continue to grow and innovate since ancient times. Ancient time models were \u2018barter resource with one another. Later models were purchase, add value and sale, and use of currency, \u2018plan, purchase raw material, manufacture a product on bigger scale, distribute and sale and profit\u2019, and the innovations still continue. A business model nowadays takes into account many factors, such as competitive advantage, experience curves, value chain, theory of portfolio of products and services, core competencies of business organisation and generic strategies. Portfolio means mix of two or more products or services. For example, producing watches and jewellery studded watches of simple to sophisticated designs. Another example is offering predictive analytics for automobile service centres as well as oil pipelines. \n\nSeveral definitions and descriptions of \u2018business model\u2019 exist in literature. A business model can be defined as a conceptual structure supporting the viability of a business, including its purpose, its goals and its ongoing plans for achieving them.5 \n\nA business model can be defined as abstract representation of an organisation and this representation may be conceptual, textual, and/or graphical. Representation is for the all the core inter-related architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements. Architecture includes organisational infrastructure and technological architecture. Representation includes many activities of present and future, and core products and/or services the organisation offers, or will offer. \n\nThe term \u2019business model\u2019 refers to \u2018uses of a range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, business process, strategy, practices and operational processes and policies including culture. \n\nA business model may focus not only on financial goals but also on the business sustainability or establishing a corporate culture when offering value to customers. \n\nWorking on a Business Model \n\nDocumentation for a business model has many benefits, such as maintaining a focus on corporate goals and reviewing operational practices. A popular way of generating or working on a business model is using a canvas which is a visual template for developing new or documenting existing business model. The canvas was designed and developed by Alexander Osterwalder6 and his co-workers. The canvas is a single reference model. Its basis is conceptualisation similarities of a wide range of business models. \n\nA business model is \n\nan abstraction for a range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects \n\nof a business \n\nBusiness model canvas \n\nis a visual chart with a \n\nnumber of elements, which describe building \n\nblocks of a company \n\nbusiness \n\n5 http://www.whatis.techtarget.com%20business%20model/ \n\n6 A. Osterwalder, Y. Pigneur, A. Smith et al., \u201cBusiness Model Generation\u201d, Wiley, 2010 \n\n430 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA \u2018Business Model Canvas\u2019 is a visual chart with elements. The elements describe the companies or organisations product\u2019s value proposition, infrastructure, customers and finances. Figure 11.1 shows nine building blocks of this canvas. \n\nKey Activities Key Partners \n\nCost Structure \n\nKey Resources \n\nCustomer Relationships Value Propositions \n\nChannels \n\nRevenue \n\nStreams \n\nCustomer Segments \n\nDesign For Design By Day    Month    Year \n\nCanvas No\u2026\u2026\u2026. \n\nFigure 11.1 Nine building blocks of a business model canvas \n\nOsterwalder Business Model Canvas has nine business model building blocks. Three building blocks are for business infrastructure which consist of: \n\n1. Key partners: Strategic alliances between competitors or non-competitors to optimise \n\nthe operations and reduce risks of a business model 2. Key activities: Key activities to execute a company\u2019s value proposition 3. Key resources: Key resources for sustaining and supporting the business, and \n\nnecessary for creation of value to customers. Examples of resources are financial, physical, human and intellectual, customer segments, platforms, markets and diversifications of innovative products. Four building blocks are business offerings which consist of: \n\n1. Value propositions: Products and services offered, their features such as performance, \n\nefficiency, accessibility, price, cost, convenience, usability and design, and how they differ from competitors fall in this category 2. Customer relationships: Identified type of relationship of the company to be created \n\nwith their customers and targeted segments 3. Customer segments: Identified sets of customers, segments, client groups and diverse \n\ngroups based on the value propositions offered \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 431 \n\n4. Channels: Effective, fast, efficient and cost-effective channels to deliver value \n\nproposition to its targeted customers Two building blocks are for business finances which consist of: \n\n1. Cost structure: Cost constituents, such as the input raw material, manufacturing, \n\nmaintenance, packaging, logistics, machinery replacement, to be considered in offering the value propositions and services, and considerations of scopes of economies in the operations 2. Revenue stream: Identified types of income sources, such as income from sales of \n\nproduct and physical goods, usage charges for the services, charges for subscription, sales income, service usage charges, subscription charges, relationship of the company to be created with their customers and targeted segments \n\nCanvas Format \n\nTwo canvas formats are: \n\n1. Large surface printed sheet to enable sketching, creativity, analysis, understanding \n\nor discussion on business model elements 2. Web-based interface for canvas where the entries of elements can be made and \n\ncreative suggestions can be placed, understanding can be obtained, analysis can be done or discussion on business model elements can be done. \n\nExample 11.1 \n\nProblem A business model canvas for services: Suggest a business model canvas for a bank for offering banking services using Internet of ATMs. \n\nSolution \n\nFigure 11.2 shows nine building blocks of the canvas. \n\nNotes: \n\n1. Bank company is mutually dependent partner for ATM manufacturing, installation, maintenance and \n\nservices. Reason is that bank services to customers crucially depend on their products and services, and the company has a business model, which depends on the bank and bank customers. 2. Model can be modified when bank enters into strategic partnerships with other banks to serve the \n\nother banks\u2019 customers as well. \n\nSubscription Business Model \n\nOne business model is subscription business model. A customer pays for accessing the service or product at periodic intervals. For example, Internet data services, cloud platform services, data centre services etc. The customers can also make members who pay the membership fees for an organisation offering the services. Example 11.2 elucidates subscription business model. \n\n432 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nKey Activities Cash dispersal to customers and banking services, such as balance enquiry, cheque book request \n\nKey Partners (a) Bank and (b) ATM Manufacturer, Installation, maintenance and services company \n\nCost Structure Software, Machines, CCTVs, Power supplies, Electricity, Installation, Maintenance and security, Internet, Servers, Data centre, Operation staff services \n\nKey Resources \n\n(a) Banking applications/services software, (b) 24\u00d77 Internet, servers, and operational staff, (c) Data centre (d) 24\u00d77 Maintenance and security services for cash and physical machinery (ATMs, CCTVs, Light fittings, Power supplies) and security guards \n\nCustomer Relationships Bank reputation, operational efficiency, service staff, etc. \n\nValue Proposition Cash dispersal and banking services at distant places, such as residential areas, markets, malls, offices, airports, railway stations and frequently visited places \n\nChannels ATM card issue to bank customers, Bank services advertisement, etc. \n\nRevenue Streams (a) ATM services annual fees, (b) Advertisement fees at installation places and machine desktop \n\nCustomer Segment \n\nResidents Employees, Businesses, Students, Travelers \n\nDesign For ABC Bank \n\nDesign By XYZ Business Consultant \n\nDay dd Month mm Year yy \n\nCanvas No xxxxxxx. \n\nFigure 11.2 Business model canvas for offering banking services using Internet of ATMs \n\nExample 11.2 \n\nProblem Suggest a business model canvas for Internet of Streetlights and controlling of operations service. \n\nSolution \n\nFigure 11.3 shows nine building blocks of the canvas for Internet of Streetlights and control of operations with minimum electricity use. \n\nCustomisation Business Model \n\nOne business model is customisation business model. Each customer pays for customisation of a product/service. The customers can also make payment once or in part once and later, after product usage training and further improvement costs. Example 11.3 show a customised business model. \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 433 \n\nExample 11.3 \n\nProblem Suggest a customised business-model canvas for Internet-based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance scheduling. \n\nSolution \n\nFigure 11.4 shows nine building blocks of the canvas for customised Internet-based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance scheduling. \n\n11.2.2 Business Model Innovation \n\nBusiness model innovation is the development of new and unique concepts supporting an organization\u2019s financial viability, including its mission, and the processes for bringing those concepts to fruition. The primary goal of business model innovation is to realise new revenue sources by improving product value, and how the products are delivered to customers.7 \n\nFigure 11.3  Subscription business model canvas for offering Internet of streetlight services using \n\nInternet of Streetlights and control of operations with minimum electricity use \n\nKey Activities Controlling of operations of Streetlights with minimum electricity usages \n\nKey Partners \n\nStreetlights Service \n\nCost Structure \n\nTurnkey installation, Operations and maintenances for streetlights, installations, Gateway servers and Central server \n\nKey Resources \n\n(a) Sensors data for surrounding light \n\nintensity and traffic presence and density, streetlight functioning status, (b) Internet of Streetlights services and control software, (c) 24\u00d77 Internet, Gateway, Servers, (d) Cloud or data centre maintenance service \n\nCustomer Relationships Company Reputation for efficient and reliable services \n\nValue Proposition Energy Efficient Control and Efficient 24\u00d7 7 Services for Streetlights, Installation s, Gateway Servers and Central Server \n\nChannels \n\nNone \n\nRevenue Streams \n\nAnnual subscription of municipal corporation, Subscription from traffic signalling and control service, and \n\nSubscriptions of advertisers on streetlight \n\ninstallations \n\nCustomer Segment Smart city services company or Municipal corporation \n\nDesign For Internet of Streetlights Service \n\nDesign By \n\nIoT Products Design Company \n\nDay dd Month mm Year yy \n\nCanvas No xxxxxxx. \n\n7 http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/business-innovation \n\n434 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA business model needs innovation because: \n\n\u25cfNew access path to businesses and direct interaction with the customers have come into existence. The access has become fast and easy. New communication channels are now fast due to use of Internet, more powerful with low cost of computers, mobile communication and cloud computing. \n\n\u25cfDirect interactions at lower costs require modifications in marketing channels deployed earlier to reach customers. Customers also have faster and multichannel information access and better search options. \n\n\u25cfBusiness transactions have become easier and partly automated. Information about customers has become a valuable asset. \n\n\u25cfNew price models need to be worked out in new competitive environment with wider use of ICT. \n\n\u25cfDecentralised models with the customer at the centre stage are building up and therefore, business models have to be customer-centric. The model should have flexible value chain which reacts fast according to varying customer requirements. \n\n\u25cfFaster introduction of new products and new portfolio strategies due to better search options with the customers Business models of an earlier era had innovation as an interaction dimension. This has shifted to the creation dimension. \n\nFigure 11.4  Canvas for Business model of Customisation offering Internet based railroad predictive \n\nanalytics and maintenance scheduling \n\nKey Activities Sensing using network of ultrasonic sensors for railroad bed faults detection, Predictive analytics, Scheduling of maintenances \n\nKey Partners \n\nRailroad maintenance service \n\nCost Structure Turnkey installation, Operations and maintenances for sensors installations, Gateway servers, Central server, Software development and maintenance \n\nValue Proposition Customised Reliability for 24\u00d7 7 sensing of railroads, and maintaining the sensors networks, Gateway servers, Central server and operations \n\nChannels None \n\nDay dd Month mm Year yy \n\nCanvas No xxxxxxx. \n\nDesign For Internet based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance scheduling \n\nDesign By IIoT Products Design Company \n\nKey Resources Ultrasonic sensors network, Internet, Descriptive prescriptive and predictive analytics software \n\nCustomer Relation- ships Efficient and reliable Services \n\nCustomer Segment Railways maintenance service \n\nRevenue Streams Customisation fee and annual fees for software and hardware maintenance \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 435 \n\nBusiness model innovation is becoming a decisive factor for successful business. Five innovation drivers (Capgemini Consulting) are: \n\n1. Customer neighbourhood production units for fast deliveries and local sales, and \n\ncustomer involvement from the beginning 2. Revenues from new sales instead of maintenance 3. Decentralised production and service 4. Client contribution, open-source design and procurement 5. Significantly reduced capital expenditure Example 11.4 shows use of IoT leading to business-model innovation. \n\nExample 11.4 \n\nProblem How does use of IoT lead to business model innovation for railroad analytics and maintenance? \n\nSolution Figure 11.4 showed Internet-based railroad predictive analytics and maintenance scheduling. This example shows a business model innovation with uses of IoT, data analytics and visualisation technologies. Key resources of new business models are uses of an ultrasonic sensors network, Internet, software for descriptive, prescriptive and predictive analytics and visualisation using dices and slices. \n\nEarlier, a business model consisted of unautomated collection of sensors data, no use of Internet, and some use of descriptive analysis of collected data, and analysis of previously observed fault-intervals to design maintenance schedules. \n\nNew business model innovation marks a shift to the creation dimension by use of key resources shown in the figure. The use of new technologies and communication channels provide fast real-time sensors network, data collection and analytics. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfA\u00a0business model\u00a0is a concept which can be defined in a number of ways. A web source defines a business model as an abstract representation of an organisation. Representation may be conceptual, textual, and/or graphical. Representation is for all core inter-related architectural, co-operational, and financial arrangements. Architecture includes organisational infrastructure and technological architecture. Representation includes many activities of present and future. Representation includes core products and/or services the organisation offers or will offer in future. \n\n\u25cfAlexander Osterwalder and his co-workers\u2019 business model canvas is a popular way of generating or working on a business model. It can be  used as a visual template for developing new or documenting existing business model. The canvas is a visual chart of nine building blocks\u2014key partners, key activities, key resources, value propositions, and customer relationships: customer segments, channels that deliver value proposition to its targeted customers cost structure and revenue stream. \n\n\u25cfExamples of business model canvas: Internet of Streetlights and Internet-based railroad sensing and predictive-analytics-based maintenance scheduling. \n\n\u25cfBusiness model innovation is the development of new, unique concepts supporting an organisation\u2019s financial viability, including its mission, and the processes for bringing those concepts to fruition. \n\n\u25cfBusiness model innovation must in the new era shift from the interaction dimension to the creation dimension. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p462_i0.png)\n\n436 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

For example, using RFIDs in tracking service for the goods is a value proposition. Value creation means creation of a \u2018smart tracking and logistics service\u2019 from the sensed IDs of the RFIDs communication on Internet, data analytics, data visualisations and mobile communication for provisions for SMS to receiver and delivery confirmation to the sender.8 \n\nValue creation is the expansion of relationships enabled by a disruptor media (Internet) and the creation of new behaviours as a result. \n\nValue creation is the heart of any business model. It involves performing activities that enhance the value of a company\u2019s product or service (offering) and encourages customer willingness to pay. \n\nFeatures of value creation using IoT are: \n\n\u25cfIoT enables addressing the emergent needs and real-time needs using predictive analytics. \n\nSummarise value \n\npropositions and \n\nvalue creation \n\nusing IoT \n\nLO 11.2 \n\nNote: \u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\n8 https://hbr.org/2014/07/how-the-internet-of-things-changes-business-models \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 437 \n\n\u25cfInformation convergence creates new experiences for current products. Information enables innovative services. \n\n\u25cfIoT enables offering of product and services which can be updated using the Internet (such through as Wi-Fi) and create synergic value for the product. \n\n\u25cfIoT enables value capture and thus recurrent revenue. \n\n\u25cfAdds personalisation and context, and uses networked products/services. \n\n\u25cfFaster ecosystem functioning where multiple companies establish loose relationships among themselves or establish relationships with big companies. \n\nValue chain means series of actions for value creation. The base of IoT value chain is data collected using APIs for the sensors/sensor networks/M2M data or from multiple information sources. The chain includes actions using web APIs, open data, data from mobile-services network and corporate databases. \n\nFigure 11.5 (a) shows value proposition in production/manufacture-driven value chain Figure 11.5 (b) shows value creation on deploying a value chain using information-driven IoT value chain in production/manufacture/service. Figures reflect analogy between the two. \n\nInput Stages \n\n(b) \n\nSensor Networks Data \n\nCorporate Database \n\n(a) \n\nService/ Production/ Manufacture \n\nProcessing Packaging Distribution and Marketing \n\nData Store \n\nValue Offering \n\nMobile Service Network \n\nInformation \n\nLocation and Other Services Information \n\nData Adaptation Transactions \n\nProcessing \n\nDescriptive, Prescriptive \n\nand Predictive Analytics and Visualisations \n\nKnowledge \n\nCreation \n\nand Discovery \n\nFigure 11.5  (a) Value proposition in production/manufacture-driven value chain (b) Value creation \n\nusing information-driven IoT value chain in production/manufacture-driven value chain \n\nExample 11.5 \n\nProblem How does Internet of Streetlights create value, expand relationships and help in creating new behaviours when the business model is represented by the canvas at Figure 11.3 in Example 11.2? \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p464_i0.png)\n\n438 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSolution \n\nValue created is real-time energy-efficient street lighting and control. The key resources in the model are smart streetlights, sensors network data for surrounding light intensity and traffic presence and density, streetlight functioning status. Traffic presence and density data enable switching off the light in no traffic condition in the vicinity. The sensor network data expands the relationships to traffic signalling and control service in the city. The relationship creates a new behaviour. Traffic signalling links with the data network. Traffic signalling and control service, control the signalling systems at pathway junctions in the city. The service also generates traffic density reports for GPS navigation and driving in the city. \n\nThe subscriptions from the linked services generate additional revenue to the streetlights service company. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfValue creation is the expansion of relationships enabled by a disruptor media (Internet) and the creation of new behaviours as a result. \n\n\u25cfValue creation involves performing activities that enhance the value of a company\u2019s product or service (offering) and encourages customer willingness to pay. \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1. Write the definition of value proposition and value creation. 2. List features of value creation using IoT? 3. How does information enable innovative services? 4. Explain the analogy between value creation using information-driven IoT \n\nvalue chain and using production/manufacture-driven value chain from Figures 11.5(a) and (b). \n\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605\u2605 \u2605\u2605\u2605 \n\n11.4 BUSINESS MODEL SCENARIOS FOR INTERNET OF THINGS \n\nSensors, M2M, sensor networks data and the data using web APIs for multiple information sources data, open data, mobile services network information data, corporate database and knowledge database are at the input stages. The data from multiple sources and services are part of the key resources in business model scenarios for IoT. \n\nExplain IoT based \n\nbusiness model \n\nscenarios \n\nLO 11.3 \n\nBusiness Models and Processes Using IoT 439 \n\nReal-time monitoring applications are used in maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, or in fault or anomaly detection. Real-time M2M, IoT sensors and sensors network data can be used to generate events and monitor the systems. Real-time anomalies and fault detection are possible during the service, production or maintenance. Event analytics enables insight into business processes and distributed processes. This enables efficient processes and streamlines existing business processes. \n\nFigure 11.6 shows the real-time monitoring scenario in maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance or in fault or anomaly detection using IoT. \n\nCorporate Database \n\nEvent Analytics Event Processing \n\nReal-time Monitoring \n\nOutput Stages Input Stages \n\nKnowledge Database \n\nData Store \n\nM2M/IoT Devices/ Sensor  Networks Data \n\nMobile, Location and \n\nOther Services \n\nInformation \n\nEvents and \n\nMessages \n\nData Adaptation Transactions \n\nProcessing \n\nDescriptive, Prescriptive \n\nand Predictive Analytics and Visualisations \n\nService/ Production/ Manufacture \n\nKnowledge \n\nCreation \n\nand Discovery \n\nFigure 11.6  Real-time monitoring scenario in maintenance scheduling, predictive maintenance, or in \n\nfault or anomaly detection in real-time using IoT \n\nIIoT deploys connectivity to all parts of the production process: machines, products, systems, and people using the cloud and big data technology.
