The concept of IoT began \n\nDescribe the \nbasics, definition \nand vision of Internet of \n\nThings (IoT) \n\nLO 1.1 \n\n2 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nwith things classified as identity communication devices. Radio Frequency Identification \nDevice (RFID) is an example of an identity communication device. Things are tagged to \nthese devices for their identification in future and can be tracked, controlled and monitored \nusing remote computers connected through the Internet. \n\nThe concept of IoT enables, for example, GPS-based tracking, controlling and monitoring \nof devices; machine-to-machine (M2M) communication; connected cars; communication \nbetween wearable and personal devices and Industry 4.0. \n\nThe IoT concept has made smart cities a reality and is also expected to make self-driving \ncars functional very soon. 1 \n\nThe following subsections describe IoT basics, definition, vision, conceptual frameworks \nand architectures. \n\n1.1.1 \nIoT Definition \n\nThe Internet is a vast global network of connected servers, \ncomputers, tablets and mobiles that is governed by standard \nprotocols for connected systems. It enables sending, receiving, \nor communication of information, connectivity with remote \nservers, cloud and analytics platforms. \n\nThing in English has number of uses and meanings. In a dictionary, thing is a word used to \nrefer to a physical object, an action or idea, a situation or activity, in case when one does \nnot wish to be precise. Example of reference to an object is\u2014an umbrella is a useful thing in \nrainy days. Streetlight is also referred to as a thing. Example of reference to an action is\u2014 \nsuch a thing was not expected from him. Example of reference to a situation is\u2014such things \nwere in plenty in that regime. \n\nThus, combining both the terms, the definition of IoT can be explained as follows: \n\nInternet of Things means a network of physical things (objects) sending, receiving, or \ncommunicating information using the Internet or other communication technologies and \nnetwork just as the computers, tablets and mobiles do, and thus enabling the monitoring, \ncoordinating or controlling process across the Internet or another data network. \n\nAnother source, defines the term IoT as follows: \n\nInternet of Things is the network of physical objects or \u2018things\u2019 embedded with electronics, \nsoftware, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by \nexchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each \nthing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to \ninteroperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. \n\n1 For more information refer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#cite_note-99 and http://www.dailycamera.com/ \nthe-bottom-line/ci_24021170/self-driving-cars-could-be-decade-away \n\nMeaning of the words \n\nInternet, Things and \n\nInternet of Things \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview \n3 \n\n1.1.2 \nIoT Vision \n\nInternet of Things is a vision where things (wearable watches, \nalarm clocks, home devices, surrounding objects) become \n\u2018smart\u2019 and function like living entities by sensing, computing \nand communicating through embedded devices which interact \nwith remote objects (servers, clouds, applications, services and \nprocesses) or persons through the Internet or Near-Field Communication (NFC) etc. The \nvision of IoT can be understood through Examples 1.1 and 1.2. \n\nExample 1.1 \n\nThrough computing, an umbrella can be made to function like a living entity. By installing a tiny embedded \ndevice, which interacts with a web based weather service and the devices owner through the Internet \nthe following communication can take place. The umbrella, embedded with a circuit for the purpose of \ncomputing and communication connects to the Internet. A website regularly publishes the weather report. \nThe umbrella receives these reports each morning, analyses the data and issues reminders to the owner at \nintermittent intervals around his/her office-going time. The reminders can be distinguished using differently \ncoloured LED flashes such as red LED flashes for hot and sunny days, yellow flashes for rainy days. \n\nA reminder can be sent to the owner\u2019s mobile at a pre-set time before leaving for office using NFC, \nBluetooth or SMS technologies. The message can be\u2014(i) Protect yourself from rain. It is going to rain. Don\u2019t \nforget to carry the umbrella; (ii) Protect yourself from the sun. It is going to be hot and sunny. Don\u2019t forget to \ncarry the umbrella . The owner can decide to carry or not to carry the umbrella using the Internet connected \numbrella. \n\nExample 1.2 \n\nStreetlights in a city can be made to function like living entities through sensing and computing using \ntiny embedded devices that communicate and interact with a central control-and-command station through \nthe Internet. Assume that each light in a group of 32 streetlights comprises a sensing, computing and \ncommunication circuit. Each group connects to a group-controller (or coordinator) through Bluetooth or \nZigBee. Each controller further connects to the central command-and-control station through the Internet. \n\nThe station receives information about each streetlight in each group in the city at periodic intervals. \nThe information received is related to the functioning of the 32 lights, the faulty lights, about the presence \nor absence of traffic in group vicinity, and about the ambient conditions, whether cloudy, dark or normal \ndaylight. \n\nThe station remotely programs the group controllers, which automatically take an appropriate action \nas per the conditions of traffic and light levels. It also directs remedial actions in case a fault develops \nin a light at a specific location. Thus, each group in the city is controlled by the \u2018Internet of streetlights\u2019. \nFigure 1.1 shows the use of the IoT concept for streetlights in a city. \n\nVision of IoT\u2014things \n\nbecoming intelligent, \n\nsmart and behaving \n\nalive \n\n4 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nInternet \n\nCentral command-and-control station \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 1 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 2 \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nGroup Controllers 1 and 2 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 3 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 4 \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nStreetlight \nStreetlight \n\nGroup Controllers 3 and 4 \n\nFigure 1.1 \nUse of Internet of Things concept for streetlights in a city \n\n1.1.3 Smart and Hyperconnected Devices \n\nAs per Collins Dictionary, hyperconnectivity means use of \nmultiple systems and devices to remain constantly connected to social \nnetworks and streams of information . Smart devices are devices \nwith computing and communication capabilities that can \nconstantly connect to networks. For example, a city network of \nstreetlights which constantly connects to the controlling station \nas shown in Figure 1.1 for its services. Another example is \nhyperconnected RFIDs. An RFID or a smart label is tagged to all consignments. This way \nmany consignments sent from a place can be constantly tracked. Their movement through \nremote places, inventories at remote locations, sales and supply chain are controlled using \na hyper-connected framework for Internet of RFIDs. \n\nFigure 1.2 shows a general framework for IoT using smart and hyperconnected \ndevices, edge computing and applications. A device is considered at the edge of Internet \ninfrastructure. Edge computing implies computations at the device level before the \ncomputed data communicates over the internet. Several new terms have been used in the \nfigure. Chapters ahead will define and explain these terms in more detail. \n\nHyperconnectivity \n\nmeans \u2018constant \nconnectivity between \n\ndevices, network, \nserver and multiple \n\nsystems\u2019. \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview \n5 \n\nEdge computing (Data element analysis and transformation) units \n\nApplications (Reporting, analysis, control); Collaborations, services and processes (involving people and \nbusiness processes); Servers for data accumulation (storage) at server; Connected data centre, cloud or \nenterprise server for data abstraction (means aggregation, fusion or compaction and access) \n\n3G, 4G, Internet, Wi-Fi \n\nBluetooth, ZigBee or NFC \n\nRFIDs, Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) and others sources of analog and digital, audio media and \nvideo-media inputs; Physical devices with sensors for measuring the pressure, temperature, velocity, \nrelative humidity, velocity, audio, video, calories spent and other health parameters \n\nFigure 1.2 A general framework for IoT using smart and hyperconnected devices, edge computing and \n\napplications \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Definition of Internet of Things \n\n\u25cf Vision of Internet of Things \n\n\u25cf Examples of communicating devices and the internet \n\n\u25cf A general framework for smart and hyperconnected devices, edge computing and applications, \ncollaborations, services and processes \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1. How can a tracking service track an object communicating its identity \n\nwhenever it comes close to an Internet Access Point (IAP) in a chain of IAPs at \nmany locations? \n2. Recall Example 1.1 of smart and alive umbrella. Draw a diagram showing \n\ncommunication of messages between the umbrella, Internet, web-based \nweather service and a mobile phone. Assuming that the service deploys \npublish/subscribe (pub/sub) communication mode, define the pub/sub mode \nof message communication between the two entities. \n3. Recall Example 1.2 of smart and alive groups of streetlights. What is the \n\nadvantage obtained when using a group controller programmed by a central \nstation through the Internet as compared to direct connectivity of each \nstreetlight with the station? \n4.

The following \nequation describes a simple conceptual framework of IoT 2 : \n\nPhysical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things \n\n\u2026 1.1 \n\nEquation 1.1 conceptually describes the Internet of umbrellas as consisting of an \numbrella, a controller, sensor and actuators, and the Internet for connectivity to a web \nservice and a mobile service provider. \n\nGenerally, IoT consists of an internetwork of devices and physical objects wherein \na number of objects can gather the data at remote locations and communicate to units \nmanaging, acquiring, organising and analysing the data in the processes and services. \nExample 1.2 showed the number of streetlights communicating data to the group controller \nwhich connects to the central server using the Internet. A general framework consists of \nthe number of devices communicating data to a data centre or an enterprise or a cloud \nserver. The IoT framework of IoT used in number of applications as well as in enterprise \nand business processes is therefore, in general, more complex than the one represented by \nEquation 1.1. The equation below conceptually represents the actions and communication \nof data at successive levels in IoT consisting of internetworked devices and objects. \n\nGather + Enrich + Stream + Manage + Acquire + Organise and Analyse \n\n\u2026 1.2 \n\nEquation 1.2 is an IoT conceptual framework for the enterprise processes and services, \nbased on a suggested IoT architecture given by Oracle (Figure 1.5 in Section 1.3). The steps \nare as as follows: \n\n1. At level 1 data of the devices (things) using sensors or the things gather the pre data \n\nfrom the internet. \n2. A sensor connected to a gateway, functions as a smart sensor (smart sensor refers to \n\na sensor with computing and communication capacity). The data then enriches at \nlevel 2, for example, by transcoding at the gateway. Transcoding means coding or \ndecoding before data transfer between two entities. \n3. A communication management subsystem sends or receives data streams at level 3. \n4. Device management, identity management and access management subsystems \n\nreceive the device\u2019s data at level 4. \n5. A data store or database acquires the data at level 5. \n6. Data routed from the devices and things organises and analyses at level 6. For \n\nexample, data is analysed for collecting business intelligence in business processes. \n\n2 McEwen, Adrian and Cassimally, Hakim, Designing Internet of Things , Wiley, 2014. \n\nAnalyse IoT \nin terms of a \nsuggested IoT \nconceptual framework \n\nLO 1.2 \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview \n7 \n\nThe equation below is an alternative conceptual representation for a complex system. \nIt is based on IBM IoT conceptual framework. The equation shows the actions and \ncommunication of data at successive levels in IoT. The framework manages the IoT services \nusing data from internetwork of the devices and objects, internet and cloud services, and \nrepresents the flow of data from the IoT devices for managing the IoT services using the \ncloud server. \n\nGather + Consolidate + Connect + Collect + Assemble + Manage and Analyse \n\n\u2026 1.3 \n\nEquation 1.3 represents a complex conceptual framework for IoT using cloud-platform- \nbased processes and services. The steps are as follows: \n\n1. Levels 1 and 2 consist of a sensor network to gather and consolidate the data. First level \n\ngathers the data of the things (devices) using sensors circuits. The sensor connects to \na gateway. Data then consolidates at the second level, for example, transformation at \nthe gateway at level 2. \n2. The gateway at level 2 communicates the data streams between levels 2 and 3. The \n\nsystem uses a communication-management subsystem at level 3. \n3. An information service consists of connect, collect, assemble and manage subsystems \n\nat levels 3 and 4. The services render from level 4. \n4. Real time series analysis, data analytics and intelligence subsystems are also at \n\nlevels 4 and 5. A cloud infrastructure, a data store or database acquires the data at \nlevel 5. \nFigure 1.3 shows blocks and subsystems for IoT in the IBM conceptual framework. New \nterms in the figure will be explained in the subsequent chapters. \n\nVarious conceptual frameworks of IoT find number of applications including the \nones in M2M communication networks, wearable devices, city lighting, security and \nsurveillance and home automation. Smart systems use the things (nodes) which consist \nof smart devices, smart objects and smart services. Smart systems use the user interfaces \n(UIs), application programming interfaces (APIs), identification data, sensor data and \ncommunication ports. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Adrian McEwen and Hakim Cassimally equation is a simple conceptualisation of a framework for IoT \nwith connectivity to a web service: \n\nPhysical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things \n\n\u25cf An equation to conceptualise a general framework for IoT with connectivity to a data centre, \napplication or enterprise server for data storage, services and business processes is: \n\nGather + Enrich + Stream + Manage + Acquire + Organise and Analyse \n\n= Internet of Things \nOrcale suggested IoT architecture is the basis for this equation. \n\n\u25cf Another equation which conceptualises the general framework for IoT using the cloud based services \nis: \n\nGather + Consolidate + Connect + Collect + Assemble + Manage and Analyse \n\n= Internet of Things \n\n8 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf IBM IoT conceptual framework blocks and components are the basis of this equation. \n\n\u25cf In general, things refer to an internetwork of devices and physical objects. This framework consists \nof a number of subsystems. The data is acquired at remote locations in a database or data store.

A model enables \nconceptualisation of a framework. A reference model can \nbe used to depict building blocks, successive interactions \nand integration.  An example is CISCO\u2019s presentation of a \nreference model comprising seven levels (Figure 1.4).

Standards for an architectural \nframework for the IoT have been developed under IEEE project P2413. IEEE working \ngroup is working on a set of guidelines for the standards. \n\nIEEE suggested P2413 3 standard for architecture of IoT. It is a reference architecture \nwhich builds upon the reference model(s). The reference architecture covers the definition \nof basic architectural building blocks and their integration \ncapability into multi-tiered systems. \n\nP2413 architectural framework 4 is a reference model that \ndefines relationships among various IoT verticals, for example, \ntransportation and healthcare. P2413 provides for the following: \n\n\u25cf Follows top-down approach (consider top layer design first and then move to the \nlowest) \n\n\u25cf Does not define new architecture but reinvent existing architectures congruent with it \n\n\u25cf Gives a blueprint for data abstraction \n\n\u25cf Specifies abstract IoT domain for various IoT domains \n\n\u25cf Recommends quality \u2018quadruple\u2019 trust that includes protection, security, privacy and \nsafety \n\n\u25cf Addresses how to document \n\n\u25cf Strives for mitigating architecture divergence(s) \nScope of IEEE P2413 standard defines an architectural framework for the IoT. It \nincludes descriptions of various IoT domains, definitions of IoT domain abstractions and \nidentification of commonalities between different IoT domains.
