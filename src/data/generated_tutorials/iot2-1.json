The concept of IoT began \n\nDescribe the basics, definition and vision of Internet of \n\nThings (IoT) \n\nLO 1.1 \n\n2 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nwith things classified as identity communication devices. Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) is an example of an identity communication device. Things are tagged to these devices for their identification in future and can be tracked, controlled and monitored using remote computers connected through the Internet. \n\nThe concept of IoT enables, for example, GPS-based tracking, controlling and monitoring of devices; machine-to-machine (M2M) communication; connected cars; communication between wearable and personal devices and Industry 4.0. \n\nThe IoT concept has made smart cities a reality and is also expected to make self-driving cars functional very soon.1 \n\nThe following subsections describe IoT basics, definition, vision, conceptual frameworks and architectures. \n\n1.1.1 IoT Definition \n\nThe Internet is a vast global network of connected servers, computers, tablets and mobiles that is governed by standard protocols for connected systems. It enables sending, receiving, or communication of information, connectivity with remote servers, cloud and analytics platforms. \n\nThing in English has number of uses and meanings. In a dictionary, thing is a word used to refer to a physical object, an action or idea, a situation or activity, in case when one does not wish to be precise. Example of reference to an object is\u2014an umbrella is a useful thing in rainy days. Streetlight is also referred to as a thing. Example of reference to an action is\u2014 such a thing was not expected from him. Example of reference to a situation is\u2014such things were in plenty in that regime. \n\nThus, combining both the terms, the definition of IoT can be explained as follows: \n\nInternet of Things means a network of physical things (objects) sending, receiving, or communicating information using the Internet or other communication technologies and network just as the computers, tablets and mobiles do, and thus enabling the monitoring, coordinating or controlling process across the Internet or another data network. \n\nAnother source, defines the term IoT as follows: \n\nInternet of Things is the network of physical objects or \u2018things\u2019 embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity to enable it to achieve greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. \n\n1For more information refer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car#cite_note-99 and http://www.dailycamera.com/ the-bottom-line/ci_24021170/self-driving-cars-could-be-decade-away \n\nMeaning of the words \n\nInternet, Things and \n\nInternet of Things \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview 3 \n\n1.1.2 IoT Vision \n\nInternet of Things is a vision where things (wearable watches, alarm clocks, home devices, surrounding objects) become \u2018smart\u2019 and function like living entities by sensing, computing and communicating through embedded devices which interact with remote objects (servers, clouds, applications, services and processes) or persons through the Internet or Near-Field Communication (NFC) etc. The vision of IoT can be understood through Examples 1.1 and 1.2. \n\nExample 1.1 \n\nThrough computing, an umbrella can be made to function like a living entity. By installing a tiny embedded device, which interacts with a web based weather service and the devices owner through the Internet the following communication can take place. The umbrella, embedded with a circuit for the purpose of computing and communication connects to the Internet. A website regularly publishes the weather report. The umbrella receives these reports each morning, analyses the data and issues reminders to the owner at intermittent intervals around his/her office-going time. The reminders can be distinguished using differently coloured LED flashes such as red LED flashes for hot and sunny days, yellow flashes for rainy days. \n\nA reminder can be sent to the owner\u2019s mobile at a pre-set time before leaving for office using NFC, Bluetooth or SMS technologies. The message can be\u2014(i) Protect yourself from rain. It is going to rain. Don\u2019t forget to carry the umbrella; (ii) Protect yourself from the sun. It is going to be hot and sunny. Don\u2019t forget to carry the umbrella. The owner can decide to carry or not to carry the umbrella using the Internet connected umbrella. \n\nExample 1.2 \n\nStreetlights in a city can be made to function like living entities through sensing and computing using tiny embedded devices that communicate and interact with a central control-and-command station through the Internet. Assume that each light in a group of 32 streetlights comprises a sensing, computing and communication circuit. Each group connects to a group-controller (or coordinator) through Bluetooth or ZigBee. Each controller further connects to the central command-and-control station through the Internet. \n\nThe station receives information about each streetlight in each group in the city at periodic intervals. The information received is related to the functioning of the 32 lights, the faulty lights, about the presence or absence of traffic in group vicinity, and about the ambient conditions, whether cloudy, dark or normal daylight. \n\nThe station remotely programs the group controllers, which automatically take an appropriate action as per the conditions of traffic and light levels. It also directs remedial actions in case a fault develops in a light at a specific location. Thus, each group in the city is controlled by the \u2018Internet of streetlights\u2019. Figure 1.1 shows the use of the IoT concept for streetlights in a city. \n\nVision of IoT\u2014things \n\nbecoming intelligent, \n\nsmart and behaving \n\nalive \n\n4 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nInternet \n\nCentral command-and-control station \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 1 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 2 \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nGroup Controllers 1 and 2 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 3 \n\nStreetlights \n\nGroup 4 \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nStreetlight Streetlight \n\nGroup Controllers 3 and 4 \n\nFigure 1.1 Use of Internet of Things concept for streetlights in a city \n\n1.1.3 Smart and Hyperconnected Devices \n\nAs per Collins Dictionary, hyperconnectivity means use of multiple systems and devices to remain constantly connected to social networks and streams of information. Smart devices are devices with computing and communication capabilities that can constantly connect to networks. For example, a city network of streetlights which constantly connects to the controlling station as shown in Figure 1.1 for its services. Another example is hyperconnected RFIDs. An RFID or a smart label is tagged to all consignments. This way many consignments sent from a place can be constantly tracked. Their movement through remote places, inventories at remote locations, sales and supply chain are controlled using a hyper-connected framework for Internet of RFIDs. \n\nFigure 1.2 shows a general framework for IoT using smart and hyperconnected devices, edge computing and applications. A device is considered at the edge of Internet infrastructure. Edge computing implies computations at the device level before the computed data communicates over the internet. Several new terms have been used in the figure. Chapters ahead will define and explain these terms in more detail. \n\nHyperconnectivity \n\nmeans \u2018constant connectivity between \n\ndevices, network, server and multiple \n\nsystems\u2019. \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview 5 \n\nEdge computing (Data element analysis and transformation) units \n\nApplications (Reporting, analysis, control); Collaborations, services and processes (involving people and business processes); Servers for data accumulation (storage) at server; Connected data centre, cloud or enterprise server for data abstraction (means aggregation, fusion or compaction and access) \n\n3G, 4G, Internet, Wi-Fi \n\nBluetooth, ZigBee or NFC \n\nRFIDs, Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) and others sources of analog and digital, audio media and video-media inputs; Physical devices with sensors for measuring the pressure, temperature, velocity, relative humidity, velocity, audio, video, calories spent and other health parameters \n\nFigure 1.2  A general framework for IoT using smart and hyperconnected devices, edge computing and \n\napplications \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfDefinition of Internet of Things \n\n\u25cfVision of Internet of Things \n\n\u25cfExamples of communicating devices and the internet \n\n\u25cfA general framework for smart and hyperconnected devices, edge computing and applications, collaborations, services and processes \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1. How can a tracking service track an object communicating its identity \n\nwhenever it comes close to an Internet Access Point (IAP) in a chain of IAPs at many locations? 2. Recall Example 1.1 of smart and alive umbrella. Draw a diagram showing \n\ncommunication of messages between the umbrella, Internet, web-based weather service and a mobile phone. Assuming that the service deploys publish/subscribe (pub/sub) communication mode, define the pub/sub mode of message communication between the two entities. 3. Recall Example 1.2 of smart and alive groups of streetlights. What is the \n\nadvantage obtained when using a group controller programmed by a central station through the Internet as compared to direct connectivity of each streetlight with the station? 4. Write the definition for Internet of Things. 5. Why is hyperconnectivity required for controlling, monitoring, collaborating, \n\nrendering services, gathering and analysing information and extracting knowledge? Explain the entities required for each. \n\n\u2605 \n\n\u2605\u2605 \n\n\u2605\u2605 \n\n\u2605 \u2605\u2605\u2605 \n\nNote: \u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p32_i0.png)\n\n6 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n1.2 IoT CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK \n\nExample 1.1 showed a single object (umbrella) communicating with a central server for acquiring data. The following equation describes a simple conceptual framework of IoT2: \n\nPhysical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things \n\n\u2026 1.1 \n\nEquation 1.1 conceptually describes the Internet of umbrellas as consisting of an umbrella, a controller, sensor and actuators, and the Internet for connectivity to a web service and a mobile service provider. \n\nGenerally, IoT consists of an internetwork of devices and physical objects wherein a number of objects can gather the data at remote locations and communicate to units managing, acquiring, organising and analysing the data in the processes and services. Example 1.2 showed the number of streetlights communicating data to the group controller which connects to the central server using the Internet. A general framework consists of the number of devices communicating data to a data centre or an enterprise or a cloud server. The IoT framework of IoT used in number of applications as well as in enterprise and business processes is therefore, in general, more complex than the one represented by Equation 1.1. The equation below conceptually represents the actions and communication of data at successive levels in IoT consisting of internetworked devices and objects. \n\nGather + Enrich + Stream + Manage + Acquire + Organise and Analyse \n\n\u2026 1.2 \n\nEquation 1.2 is an IoT conceptual framework for the enterprise processes and services, based on a suggested IoT architecture given by Oracle (Figure 1.5 in Section 1.3). The steps are as as follows: \n\n1. At level 1 data of the devices (things) using sensors or the things gather the pre data \n\nfrom the internet. 2. A sensor connected to a gateway, functions as a smart sensor (smart sensor refers to \n\na sensor with computing and communication capacity). The data then enriches at level 2, for example, by transcoding at the gateway. Transcoding means coding or decoding before data transfer between two entities. 3. A communication management subsystem sends or receives data streams at level 3. 4. Device management, identity management and access management subsystems \n\nreceive the device\u2019s data at level 4. 5. A data store or database acquires the data at level 5. 6. Data routed from the devices and things organises and analyses at level 6. For \n\nexample, data is analysed for collecting business intelligence in business processes. \n\n2 McEwen, Adrian and Cassimally, Hakim, Designing Internet of Things, Wiley, 2014. \n\nAnalyse IoT in terms of a suggested IoT conceptual framework \n\nLO 1.2 \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview 7 \n\nThe equation below is an alternative conceptual representation for a complex system. It is based on IBM IoT conceptual framework. The equation shows the actions and communication of data at successive levels in IoT. The framework manages the IoT services using data from internetwork of the devices and objects, internet and cloud services, and represents the flow of data from the IoT devices for managing the IoT services using the cloud server. \n\nGather + Consolidate + Connect + Collect + Assemble + Manage and Analyse \n\n\u2026 1.3 \n\nEquation 1.3 represents a complex conceptual framework for IoT using cloud-platform- based processes and services. The steps are as follows: \n\n1. Levels 1 and 2 consist of a sensor network to gather and consolidate the data. First level \n\ngathers the data of the things (devices) using sensors circuits. The sensor connects to a gateway. Data then consolidates at the second level, for example, transformation at the gateway at level 2. 2. The gateway at level 2 communicates the data streams between levels 2 and 3. The \n\nsystem uses a communication-management subsystem at level 3. 3. An information service consists of connect, collect, assemble and manage subsystems \n\nat levels 3 and 4. The services render from level 4. 4. Real time series analysis, data analytics and intelligence subsystems are also at \n\nlevels 4 and 5. A cloud infrastructure, a data store or database acquires the data at level 5. Figure 1.3 shows blocks and subsystems for IoT in the IBM conceptual framework. New terms in the figure will be explained in the subsequent chapters. \n\nVarious conceptual frameworks of IoT find number of applications including the ones in M2M communication networks, wearable devices, city lighting, security and surveillance and home automation. Smart systems use the things (nodes) which consist of smart devices, smart objects and smart services. Smart systems use the user interfaces (UIs), application programming interfaces (APIs), identification data, sensor data and communication ports. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfAdrian McEwen and Hakim Cassimally  equation is a simple conceptualisation of a framework for IoT with connectivity to a web service: \n\nPhysical Object + Controller, Sensor and Actuators + Internet = Internet of Things \n\n\u25cfAn equation to conceptualise a general framework for IoT with connectivity to a data centre, application or enterprise server for data storage, services and business processes is: \n\nGather + Enrich + Stream + Manage + Acquire + Organise and Analyse \n\n= Internet of Things Orcale suggested IoT architecture is the basis for this equation. \n\n\u25cfAnother equation which conceptualises the general framework for IoT using the cloud based services is: \n\nGather + Consolidate + Connect + Collect + Assemble + Manage and Analyse \n\n= Internet of Things \n\n8 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cfIBM IoT conceptual framework blocks and components are the basis of this equation. \n\n\u25cfIn general, things refer to an internetwork of devices and physical objects. This framework consists of a number of subsystems. The data is acquired at remote locations in a database or data store. The services and processes need data managing, acquiring, organising and analysing. \n\nCommu- nication Manage- ment \n\nGateway \n\nSensor \n\nNetwork Network \n\nNoSQL \n\nConnect + Collect + Assemble + Manage (Levels 3 and 4) and Cloud Services (Level 5) \n\nSmart Sensor \n\nApplication Framework \n\nIoT Commu- nication Framework \n\nApplication Framework \n\nIoT Commu- nication Framework \n\nSensors (Level 1) \n\nGather Gateway Data Consolidation (Level 2) \n\nData Consoli- dation Framework \n\nIoT Commu- nication Framework \n\nProtocol Handlers MQTT \n\nMessage Sight \n\nMessage Router \n\nMessage Cache \n\nPublish/ Subscribe \n\nInternet Firewall \n\nDatabase Firewall \n\nInformix Time Series Service \n\nDevice Register and Connect \n\nCollect from things. \n\nManage a Time- series View of Data \n\nManage Connections and Subscriptions \n\nData Centre Manage- ment \n\nServer Manage- ment \n\nBig Data Store \n\nIn-memory Analytics and Intelligence \n\nRelational Time Series Service \n\nSpatial Storage and Real Time Analytics Management \n\nFigure 1.3 IBM IoT conceptual framework \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

A model enables conceptualisation of a framework. A reference model can be used to depict building blocks, successive interactions and integration.  An example is CISCO\u2019s presentation of a reference model comprising seven levels (Figure 1.4). New terms in the figure will be explained in the subsequent chapters. \n\nLevel 7- Collaboration and Processes (Involving people and business processes) \n\nLevel 6- Application (Reporting, Analysis, Control) \n\nLevel 5- Data Abstraction (Aggregation and Access) \n\nLevel 4- Data Accumulation (Storage) \n\nLevel 3- Edge Computing (Data Element Analysis and Transformation) \n\nLevel 2- Connectivity (Communication and Processing Units) \n\nLevel 1- Physical Devices and Controllers (the things in IoT) [Sensors, machines, devices, intelligent edge nodes of different types] \n\nFigure 1.4  An IoT reference model suggested by CISCO that gives a conceptual framework for a general \n\nIoT system \n\nExplain the \n\nsuggested architectural views for IoTs amid diverse \n\ntechnologies \n\nLO 1.3 \n\nCISCO seven leveled \n\nreference model \n\n10 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA reference model could be identified to specify reference architecture. Several reference architectures are expected to co-exist in the IoT domain. Figure 1.5 shows an Oracle suggested IoT architecture.

Device access management means enabling, disabling the device access, authenticating a device for access, authorizing a device for access to a subsystem. Chapter 2 will explain these in greater detail.) \n\nAn architecture has the following features: \n\n\u25cfThe architecture serves as a reference in applications of IoT in services and business processes. \n\n\u25cfA  set of sensors which are smart, capture the data, perform necessary data element analysis and transformation as per device application framework and connect directly to a communication manager. \n\nIoT architecture by \n\nOracle \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview 11 \n\n\u25cfA set of sensor circuits is connected to a gateway possessing separate data capturing, gathering, computing and communication capabilities. The gateway receives the data in one form at one end and sends it in another form to the other end. \n\n\u25cfThe communication-management subsystem consists of protocol handlers, message routers and message cache. \n\n\u25cfThis management subsystem has functionalities for device identity database, device identity management and access management. \n\n\u25cfData routes from the gateway  through the Internet and data centre to the application server or enterprise server which acquires that data. \n\n\u25cfOrganisation and analysis subsystems enable the services, business processes, enterprise integration and complex processes (These terms are explained in Chapter 5). A number of models (CISCO, Purdue and other models) have been proposed at SWG (Sub Working Group) Teleconference of December 2014. Standards for an architectural framework for the IoT have been developed under IEEE project P2413. IEEE working group is working on a set of guidelines for the standards. \n\nIEEE suggested P24133 standard for architecture of IoT. It is a reference architecture which builds upon the reference model(s). The reference architecture covers the definition of basic architectural building blocks and their integration capability into multi-tiered systems. \n\nP2413 architectural framework4 is a reference model that defines relationships among various IoT verticals, for example, transportation and healthcare. P2413 provides for the following: \n\n\u25cfFollows top-down approach (consider top layer design first and then move to the lowest) \n\n\u25cfDoes not define new architecture but reinvent existing architectures congruent with it \n\n\u25cfGives a blueprint for data abstraction \n\n\u25cfSpecifies abstract IoT domain for various IoT domains \n\n\u25cfRecommends quality \u2018quadruple\u2019 trust that includes protection, security, privacy and safety \n\n\u25cfAddresses how to document \n\n\u25cfStrives for mitigating architecture divergence(s) Scope of IEEE P2413 standard defines an architectural framework for the IoT. It includes descriptions of various IoT domains, definitions of IoT domain abstractions and identification of commonalities between different IoT domains. Smart manufacturing, smart grid, smart buildings, intelligent transport, smart cities and e-health are different IoT domains. P2413 leverages existing applicable standards. It identifies planned or ongoing projects with a similar or overlapping scope.5 \n\n3 http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/Sept14_meeting_report-final.pdf 4 Jan H\u00f6ller et al., From Machine-to-Machine to the Internet of Things, Academic Press, 2014. 5 http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/2413/April15_meeting_report-final.pdf. \n\nIEEE P2413 standard \n\nprovides reference architecture for various \n\nIoT domains \n\n12 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfA reference model for architectural view consists of seven levels from physical devices to data storage, abstraction, application and collaboration processing (CISCO). \n\n\u25cfIoT architecture builds to serve as a reference architecture in applications of IoTs in services and business processes (Oracle). \n\n\u25cfIEEE P2413 standard provides reference architecture for the IoT that builds upon the reference models which cover the definition of basic architectural building blocks and their integration capability into multi-tiered systems. \n\n\u25cfSeveral reference architectures are expected to co-exist in IoT domains. \n\n\u25cfSpecification of abstract IoT domain for various IoT domains have been discussed. \n\n\u25cfQuality \u2018quadruple\u2019 trust that includes protection, security, privacy and safety has also been discussed. \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

An example of machine-learning software is GROK from Numenta Inc. that uses machine intelligence to analyse the streaming data from clouds and uncover anomalies, has the ability to learn continuously from data and ability to drive action from the output of GROK\u2019s data models and perform high level of automation for analysing streaming data.6 \n\nThe following five entities can be considered for the five levels behind an IoT system (Figure 1.3): \n\n1. Device platform consisting of device hardware and software using a microcontroller \n\n(or SoC or custom chip), and software for the device APIs and web applications 2.

Physical object with embedded software into a hardware. 2. consisting of a microcontroller, firmware, sensors, control unit, actuators and communication module. 3. Communication module: Software consisting of device APIs and device interface \n\nfor communication over the network and communication circuit/port(s), and middleware for creating communication stacks using 6LowPAN,  CoAP, LWM2M, IPv4, IPv6 and other protocols. 4. for actions on messages, information and commands which the devices receive and then output to the actuators, which enable actions such as glowing LEDs, robotic hand movement etc. \n\nSensors and Control Units Sensors \n\nSensors are electronic devices that sense the physical environ- ments. An industrial automation system or robotic system has multiple smart sensors embedded in it. Sensor-actuator pairs are used in control systems. A smart sensor includes computing and communication circuits. \n\nRecall Example 1.2 of Internet of streetlights. Each light has sensors for measuring surrounding light-intensity and surrounding traffic-proximity for sensing and transmitting the data after aggregation over a period. Sensors are used for measuring temperature, pressure, humidity, light intensity, traffic proximity, acceleration in an accelerometer, signals in a GPS, proximity sensor, magnetic fields in a compass, and magnetic intensity in a magnetometer. \n\nSensors are of two types. The first type gives analog inputs to the control unit. Examples are thermistor, photoconductor, pressure gauge and Hall sensor. The second type gives digital inputs to the control unit. Examples are touch sensor, proximity sensor, metal sensor, traffic presence sensor, rotator encoder for measuring angles and linear encoders for measuring linear displacements. Sensors and circuits are explained in detail in Chapter 7. \n\nControl Units \n\nMost commonly used control unit in IoT consists of a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) or a custom chip. A microcontroller is an integrated chip or core in a VLSI or SoC. Popular microcontrollers are ATmega 328, ATMega 32u4, ARM Cortex and ARM LPC. \n\nAn MCU comprises a processor, memory and several other hardware units which are interfaced together. It also has firmware, timers, interrupt controllers and functional IO units. Additionally, an MCU has application-specific functional circuits designed as per the specific version of a given microcontroller family. For example, it may possess Analog to Digital Converters (ADC) and Pulse Width Modulators (PWM). Figure 1.6 shows various functional units in an MCU that are embedded in an IoT device or a physical object.

Sensors acquire data from remote locations, which may not be easily accessible. Each wireless sensor also has communication abilities for which it uses a radio-frequency transceiver. Each node either has an analog sensor with signal conditioner circuit or a digital sensor. Sensing can be done to monitor temperature, light intensity, presence of darkness, metal proximity, traffic, physical, chemical and biological data etc. \n\nWSN Definition \n\nWireless Sensor Network (WSN) is defined as a network in which each sensor node connects wirelessly and has capabilities of computations for data compaction, aggregation and analysis plus communication and networking. WSN node is autonomous. Autonomous refers to independent computing power and capability to send requests and receive responses, and data forward and routing capabilities. \n\nA web source defines the WSN as \u201ca wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices using sensors to cooperatively monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants, at different locations.\u201d \n\nWSN Node \n\nA WSN node has limited computing power. It may change topology rapidly. The WSN network in the topology-changing environment functions as an ad-hoc network. A WSN network in that environment is generally self-configuring, self-organising, self-healing and self-discovering. WSNs are described in detail in Chapter 7. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfIoT sources are microcontroller-based boards\u2014Arduino, Intel Galileo, Intel Edison, Beagle Board and Raspberry Pi.

Each machine in an M2M system embeds a smart device. The device senses the data or status of the machine, and performs the computation and communication functions. A device communicates via wired or wireless systems. The communication protocols are 6LowPAN, LWM2M, MQTT, and XMPP. Each communication device is assigned 48-bits Ipv6 address. \n\n1.6.1 M2M to IoT \n\nIoT technology in industry involves the integration of complex physical machinery M2M communication with the networks of sensors, and uses analytics, machine learning, and knowledge discovery software. \n\nM2M technology closely relates to IoT when the smart devices or machines collect data which is transmitted via the Internet to other devices or machines located remotely. The close difference between M2M and IoT is that M2M must deploy device to device, and carry out the coordination, monitoring, controlling of the devices and communicate without the usage of Internet whereas IoT deploys the internet, server, internet protocols and server or cloud end applications, services or processes. \n\nM2M has many applications in fields such as industrial automation, logistics, smart grid, smart cities, health and defence. Initial applications of M2M were found in automation and instrumentation only, but now these include telemetric applications and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as well. \n\nOutline the functions of M2M architectural domains and relationships of an \n\nM2M system with an \n\nIoT system \n\nLO 1.6 \n\nInternet of Things: An Overview 23 \n\nExample 1.4 \n\nProblem Give examples of usages of M2M and IIoT. \n\nSolution \n\n1.
