A design uses number of technologies \ndue to number of layers through which data communicates, processes and is analysed \n(Figures 1.2 to 1.5). Production of an IoT system is planned after the prototype is \nsatisfactorily tested, simulated and debugged. \n\nFollowing are key terms which need to be understood learn project case studies for IoT \nsystems. \n\nService refers to a set of related software functionalities/components. The set is reused for \none or more purposes. The set enables the provisioning of access to one or more capabilities. \nAn interface of a service provides the access to capabilities. The access to each capability \nis consistent with the constraints and policies, as specified by a service description. \nExamples of service capabilities are provisioning of security, bank transactions, device \nIDs management and device or vehicle tracking. \n\nWeb service refers to a service using web protocols, web objects or WebSockets. For \nexample, location, weather reporting, traffic density reporting or streetlights monitoring \nand controlling service. \n\nCloud computing is a collection of services available over the Internet that deliver \ncomputational storage, software or infrastructure functionalities, such as a service \nprovider for connected systems, and for enabling distributed, grid and utility computing. \n\nPaaS is a service model in which the platform is made available to a developer of application, \nservice or process on demand. PaaS developed applications, services and processes which \nexecute using the platform for computing, data store and distribution computing nodes \nare made available through Internet on-demand. The platform, network, resources, \nmaintenance, updating, and security as per the developer requirements are responsibility \nof the cloud service provider. \n\nExamples of services are communication management functions, a deployment \nserver for sending and receiving messages from the device agents, diverse sources and \ndevices data store, big data store, server data and DBMS management functions, events \nprocessing, message caching and routing, OLTP, OLAP, data analytics for IoT /M2M or \nother applications/services/business processes, intelligence, and knowledge discovery. \n\nCloud-connected device platform refers to a cloud services platform for the devices \nconnectivity, control, monitoring, applications, services and other functions. \n\nCloud-connected Universe Platform (CUP) refers to a cloud services platform for the multi- \nsources and systems data and devices connectivity, a controls, monitoring, applications, \nservices and other functions.

The platform charges recurring expenses as per \nused/rendered services by the platform. \n\nDomain agnostic platform refers to a platform which functions and renders services on \nvirtually any business domain. \n\nPredictive analytics is an advanced analytics technique that is used  to answer the question\u2014 \nWhat will happen? The answer is based on interpretations of the outputs and results \nfrom advanced descriptive analytics, data visualisation and other methods. For example, \nCaterpillar Inc. has been running over 3 million construction equipment machines across \nthe globe. Predictive analytics of the data over the Internet from the machines predicts and \nreports the failures to Caterpillar service and maintenance centres. 1 Other examples are \npredicting (i) expected fault from stress build-up data from sensors placed all along an oil \npipeline, (ii) expected component failure from embedded sensors data in a connected car, \nor (iii) customer behavioural changes and preferences for advance planning of production \nor logistics. \n\nData visualisation refers to examining and viewing the results from an analytics process, or \nprocess for intelligence or knowledge on a dashboard, infographic, or other applications. \nVisualisation may be for data dices and slices (Section 5.5.1 and Example 5.10). \n\nInfographic refers to information graphic or graphic visual representation of information, \ndata or knowledge that enables easy viewing or use and clear recognition of view or \ntrends or patterns. 2 \n\nAutomated dashboard or infographic refers to creation of dashboard or infographic by \nsoftware, such as analytics or business process. \n\nConnected car refers to a car that is equipped with Internet access, and usually also \nwith a WLAN. The car shares its Internet access with other devices both on the inside \nand outside, and is also outfitted with special technologies that tap into the Internet or \nWLAN, and provide additional benefits to the driver. Another definition from McKinsey \nfor connected car is \u2018a vehicle which optimises its own operation and maintenance as \nwell as the convenience and comfort of passengers using on-board sensors and Internet \nconnectivity.\u2019 3 \n\n1 http://www.caterpillar.com/en/news/caterpillarNews/ \n2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic \n3 mhttp://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/whats-driving-the-connected-car and http:// \nwww.autoconnectedcar.com/2014/04/152-million-connected-cars-in-2020-with-14-5-billion-in-revs-very-big-data/ \n\nIoT Case Studies \n449 \n\nR is a statistical computing and graphics language and environment that includes number \nof statistical linear and nonlinear modelling, time series analysis, statistical tests, and \nclassifications and clustering. \n\nCVS (Concurrent Versions System) client refers to a software client for revision control for \na development software. The client tracks all work and all changes in a set of files that \nallows collaboration among the developers, separated in space and time. \n\nGit client refers to a built-in open source GUI tool used during browsing and sending a \nrequest for a response to a server. A Git-client user gets a platform-specific experience, \nsuch as Windows experience. \n\nPyDev refers to a Python IDE for Eclipse code development in Python, Jthyon or IronPython. \n\nOver-The-Air Programming (OTP) means program memory is reprogrammed through \nwireless transceiver when the functioning of an embedded software circuit needs \nmodification. For example, for extending capabilities or installing a new version or path \nwith the program. \n\nLow Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) refers to a type of wireless telecommunication \nnetwork designed to allow long-range communications that communicate at a low bit rate \namong things (connected objects), such as WSNs and battery-operated sensors. A number \nof standards are included in LPWAN. Examples are LTE Advanced for Machine Type \nCommunications (LTE-MTC) for connected thing, and LoRaWAN (Low power and range \nWAN) specification released in 2015. WAN stands for Wide Area Network. \n\nIFTTT refers to free web-service from a company named as IFTTT. 4 Its name is derived \nfrom the service which enables a service user to create a sequential set of conditional \nstatements (If This Then That), called applets which trigger actions by change to other \nweb services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail. The web APIs control the actions. A trigger \ncorresponds to \u2018this\u2019 and action corresponds to \u2018that\u2019. A trigger can provide ingredient (basic \ndata, such as picture or e-mail sender address, subject, body, attachment, receive date) for \naction . The action task can be communicating content on a social network. Presently IFTTT \noperating system versions are Android 4.1 onwards and iOS7 onwards which enable \nservices such as smart home controls and automation using mobile phones or tablets. \n\nSection 12.2 describes design complexity levels and design approach of using a connected \nPlatform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud for accelerating design, development and deployment \nof M2M, IoT, IIoT applications and services. Section 12.3 describes the applications of \ndevelopment platforms for IoT/IIoT in globally trending usages in premises, supply chain, \ncustomer and product monitoring areas.

An ATM system deploys \na number of subsystems. Consider a project of designing \nsurveillance subsystem for each ATM. A design process is \ndivided into a number of steps as given below. \n\nAbstraction \n\nA developer first abstracts the suspicious activity detection as a system event for the \nactivities that endangers the physical safety of the machine and its cash. On the events at \nthe premise, the triggers, messages and data communicates to the banking system in real \ntime using the Internet as a communication channel. The developer abstracts the video \nclips recorded from the camera as data files from the system that communicate to data store \nat a surveillance-system server for a group of bank ATMs. A software developer abstracts \nthe hardware as source of events and data files and abstracts software as communicating \nprocess for the triggers, messages, data and data files. \n\nReference Model for Surveillance System \n\nTwo domains and their high-level service capabilities in the surveillance system IoT \narchitecture reference model are: \n\n(1) Device and gateway domain deploy digital camera, spatially arranged vibration \n\nsensors at an ATM premise devices and media-server gateway for the surveillance. \nThe domain high-level capabilities are: \n\n\u25cf Enriches the sensors and camera data into the events, data files, and processes the \nevents generated, data filters, time stampings and encrypting \n\n\u25cf Media Server Gateway communicates the enriched data deploying the TCP/IP. \n\nSteps in designing a \npremises monitoring \n\nsystem\u2014connected \nATMs physical security \n\nsystem \n\n462 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n(2) Applications and network domain deploys the applications and services and have \n\nhigh-level capabilities as follows\u2014surveillance management functions using the \naccessed data. The functions include initiation of actions on detection of security \nbreaches at the ATM, and data storage and organising functions for the video files. \nFigure 12.3 shows the data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for \nthe ATM premise monitoring and the surveillance system management functions and \nservices. \n\nNetwork \n\nInternet Firewall \n\nDatabase Firewall \n\nAnalytics \n\nWiMax \n\nDevice and Gateway Domain \nApplications and Network Domain \n\nEvents \n\nDigital \nVideo \nCamera \n\nVibration \n\nSensors \n\nEmbedded \n\nSensors \n\nSensors \nNetworks \n\nData \n\nMedia Server \n\nGateway \n\nActivity \nIntervals \nVideo files \n\nEvent \nIntervals for \n\nVideo files \n\nVideo \nProcessing \n\nand \nFiltering \n\nWiFi \nCommuni- \n\ncation \n\nAccess \nNetwork \nManagement \n\nHTTPS, \nTCP, UDP, \nIP Protocol \n\nHandlers \n\nEvent \nMessages \n\nRouter \n\nOn event \n\nFiles \nCache \n\nVideo \n\nFiles \nCache \n\nMedia \nServer \nDevices and \n\nSensors \nManagement \n\nATM \nAccess and \n\naccess \nManage- \n\nment \n\nATM \nEvent \nMessages, \n\nVideo \nFiles and \n\nData \n\nATM Sensors \n\nand Cameras \nManagement \n\nATMs Surveillance System Server \n\nServer Data \nManagement \n\nBig \nData \nStore \n\nEvent \nMessage \n\nRouting \n\nEvent \nProcessing \n\nDatabase \n\nRDBMS \n\nSurveillance \n\nManagement \nApplications\\ \n\nServices \n\nFigure 12.3 Data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for the ATM premise \n\nmonitoring and the surveillance system management functions and services \n\nIdentifying Requirements of Device and Gateway Domain \n\nDevices hardware design components are 24 \u00a5 7 active digital video cameras; number \nof spatially-distributed embedded vibration-sensors at the ATM premises; sensors data \nprocessing for detection of suspicious activities; video-processing and filtering hardware; \ncommunication network connectivity for the events, and on the event, real-time videos \nand communication network connectivity for the large voluminous data of video clips of \ntransaction activities of users. \n\nIoT Case Studies \n463 \n\nSoftware design modules at the device domain are software components for embedded \ndevice such as the distributed vibration sensors processing their data; filtering and extraction \nof events; communication on the events and on the event videos in real time; embedded \ncamera device video filtering out irrelevant video clips of inactivity intervals data and \nextracting the relevant intervals video files; and media server gateway for communication \nof events and on-event video files to the bank server in real time. Large voluminous data of \nvideo clips communicate to the data store during periods of inactivity at the ATM. \n\nIdentifying Requirements of Network Sub-domain \n\nNetwork hardware and software design components are Wi-Fi/WiMax access network, \ncore IP network, and surveillance system server. Software design components are network \nmanagement functions to ensure secure communication network between the device and \ngateway domain and applications/services. \n\nIdentifying Requirements of Application Sub-domain \n\nSoftware design components are data store organising functions; and surveillance \nmanagement functions are real-time events processing and \u2018on the event\u2019 video file, \nactivating the alarms (SMS alerts to bank authorities and city police authorities). \n\nDesign Implementation of Device and Gateway Domain Hardware and Software \n\nAn implementation of ATM premise circuits and embedded sensor devices software needs \nhigh computing power for video and multimedia processing. Let us recall Section 8.3.4. \nRaspberry Pi 2 model B+ (RPi 2) can be deployed for the prototype embedded real-time \nsystems for 24 \u00a5 7 active digital video cameras; spatially-distributed embedded vibration \nsensors; sensors data processing; video processing and filtering; and communication \nnetwork. \n\nRPi 2 CPU is quad-core ARM Cortex-A7/ 900 MHz and a graphic processor (Broadcom \nVideoCore IV) for graphics and video, 1 GB RAM, plus multimedia card module, \nMicroSDHC card. The RPi 2 provides high-performance computing and graphics. \n\nSection 9.2.3 described the programming of Raspberry Pi platform. AdafruitIDE, a web- \nbased IDE can be deployed for prototype development. Open source ARM videoCore \ndriver enables driving of the camera hardware. Open source Raspbian provisions a Linux \ndistribution using OS. \n\nSection 9.3 described Eclipse IoT stack-based end-to-end IoT solutions with Java and \nOSGi. A developer can code using following Eclipse stack components for abstractions, \nsoftware and gateway software in embedded sensors and devices: \n\n1. Eclipse Mihini hardware abstraction and other services in embedded Lua runtime \n2. Eclipse.Pi4J for the development of embedded sensor devices software using the \n\nframework based on WiringPi and PiFace, Gertboard and other shields \n3. Eclipse Koneki functions for development of device applications in embedded Lua \n\nlanguage \n4. Eclipse Krikkit rules system for configuring the device platforms \n\n464 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n5. Eclipse Kura for the Raspberry Pi and the Kura development environment, Gateway. \n\nServices, cloud connectivity, management of device, network configuration and \napplications. \n\nDesign Implementation of Application and Network Domain Software \n\nThe developer uses OLTP for data store to activate interval time and location stamped \n(Section 5.4.1) video files. Software developer uses event analytics (Section 5.5.2) for \ndeveloping surveillance management functions. \n\nTesting and Validation \n\nThe implanted hardware/software of both domains needs to be thoroughly tested in the \nlaboratory environment by using sensors and cameras. \n\n12.3.2 \nCase Study: Connected RFIDs Supply Chain Monitoring Project \n\nSupply-chain monitoring process is important for companies, \ndistributors and manufacturers. The IoT applications and \nservices consist of Supply-Chain Order Verification, Automated \nReordering and Shipping (SCOVARS) operations. The operations \ninvolved are planning and scheduling of production, scheduling \ndeliveries, shipping, delivery confirmation from customer, \nautomated reordering from customers, order verification, \nacknowledgement operations which repeat in each cycle. \n\nAn example of applications of SCOVARS is sale of toys, such as LEGO at stores and \nplanning and scheduling of production of toys. Inventory control of each kind of toys uses \nthe RFID labels at the toys, packages and containers for shipping. Whenever a toy sells at \na store, such as WalMart, the inventory auto adjusts. Reordering of the toys sold during \na week takes place using an app for automated reordering at the customer\u2019s end. When a \nreordering event occurs, then that processes at a server and the event messages route to \nthe ERP applications at the LEGO enterprise. \n\nSection 1.1.3 introduced RFID, its functions, role and uses in IoT applications. Sections \n1.5.2 and 7.6.1 explained connected RFID devices and RFID readers at both the customer \nend and enterprise end. A developer divides the design process into a number of steps as \nfollows. \n\nAbstraction of SCOVARS \n\nProduction End (PE) assigns an identity to a root node (level 0) of data tree. Supply End \n(SE) assigns identities at daughter data-nodes (level 1) for each shipment. Shipping Node \n(SN) assigns identities at container data nodes (level 2). Shipping End (SHE) consists \nof identities of group of containers data nodes (level 3). Sales Organisation End (SOE) \nreceiving the group of toy containers consists of identities of containers at data nodes \n\nSteps in designing a \nsupply-chain monitoring \n\nsystem\u2014connected \n\nRFIDs system \nsupply chain order \nverification, automated \nreordering and shipping \n\n(SCOVARS) \n\nIoT Case Studies \n465 \n\n(level 4). Point of Sale End (POSE) assigns the identities at leaf nodes. A code designer \nabstracts the PE to POSE end-to-end communication as communication of data trees. Each \ndata tree has data nodes with Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs), messages, alerts and \ntriggers. Data nodes are distributed nodes in the PE-POSE supply chain network. \n\nThe code designer abstracts the POSE to PE end-to-end communication as communication \nof events, alerts, triggers, messages and data files. Each file has reordering information. \n\nArchitecture Reference Model for SCOVARS \n\nDesigner considers ITU-T four-layers (Figure 2.2) architecture as the reference. The \nlayers have generic management, specific management and management and security \ncapabilities. Four layers for Internet of RFIDs for SCOVARS are: \n\nLayer 1: Device layer capabilities and gateway capabilities are present in RFID physical \ndevice-cum-RFID reader, which uses the URI at each node. \n\nLayer 2: Transport and network capabilities use the protocol handlers and Internet \nconnectivity. \n\nLayer 3: Services and application-support layer capabilities at a server node are RFID \ndevices URI registry, access management, URI management and URI time series, server \nnode database, events processing and data analytics. \n\nLayer 4: Services and applications capabilities perform the tracking, plan and schedule \nproduction, schedule deliveries, shipping, order verification, and acknowledgement \noperations. \n\nDesign Implementation of Layer Hardware/Software \n\nDesign implementation and prototyping of the devices between \nPE and POSE ends needs Arduino-like computing power. \nPrototype development can be done using Arduino Yun which \ncombines the Arduino-based board with Linux. This is because \nof the two processors, ATmega32u4 for support to Arduino and \nAtheros AR9331 for running Linux. IoT application enablers are Wi-Fi, Ethernet support, \na USB port, micro-SD card slot, 3 reset buttons and more. The Yun can be controlled from \nanywhere with any Internet-connected web browser without assigning an IP address to the \nboard. WebSockets can also be used for providing real-time full-duplex communication \nover TCP. 10 \n\nRefer Section 8.2\u2014Arduino board can be programmed using downloadable tools. \nArduino IDE is the tool for the software development of embedded devices that makes \napplication development easy. For example, a software serial library is provided in the \nIDE for a microcontroller system. The library consists of number of programs. The distinct \nprogram exists for each serial interface protocol. The program enables a user to directly \nuse these protocol specific programs, such as using a program for reading an RFID tag or \nusing a program for sending data to USB port for onward transmission on the Internet. \n\n10 http://asynkronix.se/internet-of-things-with-arduino-yun-and-yaler/ \n\nArduino board for \nprototyping the devices \nbetween PE and POSE \n\nends \n\n466 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nA software serial library is provided in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) \nfor a microcontroller system. The library consists of a number of programs. \n\nSection 9.3 described Eclipse IoT stack-based end-to-end IoT solutions with Java and \nOSGi. Software developer can use Eclipse Kura development environment, gateway, \nservices, cloud connectivity, management of device, network configuration and \napplications. \n\nDesign Implementation of Applications in SCOVARS \n\nThe developer can use connected devices or connected universe platform. The software \nrequirements are event processing and transaction processing, database functions and \nevent analytics (Section 5.5.2) for the development. \n\nTesting and Validation \n\nThe implanted hardware/software at each end-point between POSE and PE needs to be \nthoroughly tested in a laboratory environment. Arduino IDE is open source and provides \nembedded hardware and software platform, simulating and debugging. \n\n12.3.3 \nCase Study: Customer monitoring in IoT Applications/Services Project \n\nData from tracking of customers and customer database \nprovides the behaviours, preferences, locations, usage patterns \nand product health. Applications such as business planning, \nanalytics, health, services and manufacturing use this data. \nConsider \u2018tracking of customers carrying Internet-connected \ndigital devices\u2019 (TCCICDD) project for the IoT applications and \nservices case study. \n\nTracking is done using customer\u2019s Internet-connected mobile \napps and wearable digital devices, customer databases, customer-end embedded devices \nand sensors. Information from customer feedbacks, the sale services and maintenance \ncentres also enable tracking. Tracking customers and their information enable creation of \ninnovative products, intelligent infrastructure, enhancing the operational efficiencies, craft \nprovisioning of new customer experiences, and offer unique services to their customers. \n\nAn example is usage of customer behaviour, preferences, locations analytics and \nvisualisation for sale services, customer feedbacks and preference for creating information \nfor controlling supply chain and boosting sales. \n\nTCCICDD design process can be divided into a number of steps as follows. \n\nAbstraction for TCCICDD \n\nA designer abstracts the sensors and devices data as device messages. The designer abstracts \nthe customer data for TCCICDD as devices messages, events, alerts and triggers. The \nsensors are put at the places of customer\u2019s visits, such as malls and company sales centres. \n\nCustomer tracking and \n\ncustomer database \n\nof behaviours, \npreferences, locations, \n\nusage patterns and \nproduct health for the \ninnovative applications \n\nand services \n\nIoT Case Studies \n467 \n\nThe messages include customer ID, location and time stamps. The designer abstracts \ncontents as devices database. The database deploys the time-series information of the \ncustomer feedbacks, the sale services and maintenance centres. \n\nThe data store at the server for time series and location-stamped customer data, \ncustomer database and network accessed data, messages and events. \n\nCommunication gateway and the Internet abstract as network. Network consists of \ncommunication between the customer data, customer database and device messages and \na connected universe or other PaaS. \n\nArchitecture Reference Model for TCCICDD \n\nLet TCCICDD project designer deploy Oracle reference model architecture (Figure 1.5) for \nthe applications of IoTs in services and business processes. Five layers in project reference \nmodel are as follows: \n\nLayer 1 (Gather): A Mobile app of the company and apps at wearable and other devices \nconnected devices send customer data to the gateway for change of locations, product \nhealth, preferences, usages of the product and feedbacks.

Its accompanying \ncloud platform 12 my.openHAB provides communication between that with the cloud. \nThe my.openHAB cloud-connector also provides REST (Section 3.4.4) and cloud-based \nservices, such as IFTTT (Section 12.1). The operating system versions Android 4.1 onwards \nand iOS7 onwards for IFTTT, enable services such as smart home controls and automation \nusing mobile phones or tablets. OpenHAB computing environment is Java. GUI clients \nare designed and can be used as downloads from git. 13 IDE, guidelines, bindings for \ncode development are provided for openHAB. 14 Figure 12.7 shows architectural layers in \nopenHAB development environment. \n\nA service in figure refers to service capabilities, which can be called upon whenever \nneeded. The figure shows the following: \n\n1. Core openHAB objects\u2014REST service and repository; base library \n2. openHAB add-on objects\u2014Item provider, protocol bindings, automation logics, user \n\ninterfaces and libraries \n3.

OpenHAB deploys event administration service of OSGi with pub/sub mode. \n5. A stateful repository is for querying and for use by automation logics. Some functions \n\nare stateless and do not depend on previous action(s). Remaining actions are stateful \nand dependent on previous chain of actions. State of items in repository is as per the \nactions. \nTwo domains and their high-level service capabilities in the home automation system \nin IoT architecture reference model are: \n\n1. Device and Gateway Domain : Assume that the system deploys j lighting devices, \n\neach with a proximity sensor . Automation logic provides that if no change is found \nin proximity due to presence of person(s) then the devices switch off. Assume that \nthe system also deploys k intrusion sensors and l appliances. Automation logic \nprovides on intrusion, communicate trigger(s) to a local or remote web-service as per \nconfiguration setting at the configuration administration service of OSGi framework. \n2. Application and Network Domain : Applications and network domain deploys \n\napplications and services and have high-level capabilities. \n\nDomain Architectural Reference Model \n\nFigure 12.8 shows the data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for \nhome automation lighting, appliances and intrusion monitoring services. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p506_i0.png)\n480 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nmy.openHAB. org \n\nHTTP Service \n\nDevice and Gateway Domain \nApplications and Network Domain \n\nAutomation Logic \n\nopenHAB \n\nEvents Bus \n\nUser Interfaces \n\nItem Provider \n\nAndroid \n\niOS \n\nApplets (Trigger and Actions) \n\nAnalytics \n\nControl of Home Devices \n\nRemote Control of Internet \n\nConnected Home Devices \n\nSmart \nLights \n1,\u2026, i \n\nProximity \n\nSensors \n\n1,\u2026, j \n\nIntrusion \n\nSensors \n\n1,\u2026, k \n\nAppliances \n\n1, \u2026, l \n\nProtocol Bindings \n\nEvent \nMessages \n\nRouter \n\nOSGi \nFramework \n\nEvent \nMessage \n\nRouting \n\nEvent \nProcessing \n\nHome Event \n\nMessages \n\nIntrusion \nData Files \n\nIFTTT \n\nApplications/ \n\nServices \n\ne-Mail \n\nSocial \nMedia \n\nSet of Web \n\nServices \n\nFigure 12.8 Data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for home automation \n\nlighting, appliances and intrusion monitoring services \n\nFigure shows that openHAB has an event bus. The bus is asynchronous. The event bus \nrefers to a communication bus for all protocol bindings. The bindings link to the hardware. \nThe event bus is the base service of openHAB. Example of the event is command, which \ntriggers an action or a state change of some item or device. Another example of event is \nstatus update which informs about a status change of some item or device. For example, \nin response to a command. \n\nThe openHAB service is integration-hub between such devices and bindings between \ndifferent protocols used for networking the home devices, OSGi and HTTP service. Usually \njust one instance of openHAB runs on a central coordinator (computer) at home. Event \nAdministration Service of OSGi service is used for remote services. Several distributed \nopenHAB instances can connect and deploy the event bus. \n\nCode Development Environment, Development, Debugging and Deployment \n\nThe openHAB development uses the Eclipse IDE (Section 9.3.1) for Java Developers. \nDevelopment environment can be selected as Windows (32 or 64), Linux or Mac. The \nEclipse Installer adds all required plug-ins, provides encoding settings for workspace, \npre-configured code formatters and automatically prepares the IDE. Workspace compiles \nand provides runtime by opting\u201c openHAB_Runtime\u201d configuration. \n\nIoT Case Studies \n481 \n\nThe openHAB platform is neutral to hardware and interfacing protocols. For example, \na security camera device may be on Raspberry platform and lighting devices on Arduino. \nThe automation logics can connect different systems. Bus systems, devices and protocols \nhave dedicated bindings to openHAB. Each binding User Interface (UI) design can have \nunique look and feel. A binding sends and receives the commands, and status updates on \nopenHAB event bus. \n\nThe openHAB brings together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface \nprotocols. The dedicated bindings facilitate this. The openHAB solution aims for \nprovisioning a universal integration platform for the devices. The codes are written in \nJava and are fully based on OSGi . The Equinox OSGi runtime and Jetty as a web server \nbuild the core foundation of the runtime. \n\nDevices hardware design components are 24 \u00a5 7 active digital video cameras for \nintrusion detection, number of spatially-distributed embedded proximity sensors, the \nhome premises; sensors data processing for detection of suspicious activities; video- \nprocessing and filtering hardware; communication network connectivity to the events \nbus, and on the event, communication network connectivity. \n\nSoftware design modules at the device domain are software components for embedded \ndevice distributed proximity sensors data processing; filtering and extraction of events; \nand communication on the events, and media server gateway for communication of \nevents. \n\nIdentifying Requirements of Network Sub-domain \n\nNetwork hardware and software design components are Wi-Fi/WiMax access network, \ncore IP network, and server. Software design components are network management \nfunctions to ensure secure communication network between device and gateway domain \nand applications/services. \n\nThe openHAB cloud connector connects the local openHAB runtime to a remote \nopenHAB cloud, such as my.openHAB, instance from openHAB foundation. 15 \n\nDesign Implementation of Device and Gateway Domain Hardware and Software \n\nSection 7.2.2 described the sensors which can be deployed for a number of home \nautomation applications. An implementation of home premise intrusion circuits and \nembedded sensor devices software needs high computing power for intrusion detection. \nSection 8.3.4 described Raspberry Pi 2 model B+ (RPi 2) which can be deployed due to \nhigh computing power. \n\nAn implementation of home premise lighting and appliances embedded sensor devices \nsoftware needs computing power for lighting automation and Arduino or RPi boards can \nbe deployed. \n\nThe openHAB can be used for end-to-end solutions for smart home applications and \nservices. Section 9.3.2 described Eclipse IoT stack-based end-to-end IoT solutions with \n\n15 https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/openHAB-Cloud-Connector \n\n482 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nJava and OSGi. A developer can code using Eclipse stack components for abstractions, \nsoftware and gateway software in embedded sensors and devices. Sample projects using \nopenHAB are given at Github. 16 \n\n12.5.2 Smart City \n\nSmart city applications and services connect people, process, \ndata and things. A smart city can be defined as a vision which \nintegrates multiple ICT and IoT solutions in a secure fashion \nto manage a city\u2019s assets such as information systems, schools, \nlibraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, water \nsupply networks, waste management, law enforcement and \nother community services. Sectors that have been developing \nsmart city technology include government services, transport \nand traffic management, energy, health care, water, innovative urban agriculture and \nwaste management. 17 \n\nSmart-city solutions integrate a number of city services and can include the following 18 : \n1. Smart parking spaces \n2. Smart street lightings and smart lighting solutions, such as SimplySNAP smart \n\nlighting solution which enables the development, control, and optimisation of a \nsmart lighting implementation, developed by Synapse Wireless partnering with \nThingWorx \n3. Smart traffic solutions, such as smart energy management, smart parking, smart \n\nwaste bins, smart street lighting, and security and surveillance, developed by Tech \nMahindra partnering with ThingWorx \n4. Smart water management, such as AquamatiX for monitoring and optimizing a city\u2019s \n\nwater and sewage services \n5. Smart connected bike share services \n6. Smart health services \n7. Smart structures (building, bridges and historical monuments) health, vibrations and \n\nmaterial conditions monitoring, analysing and managing structures health data to \nimprove energy usage, maintenance, operations, and comfort solution. For example \nusing solutions developed by WiseUp partnering with ThingWorx platform \n8. Smart city system integrator, such as Pactera from ThingWorx \n\nArchitectural View \n\nFigure 1.12 shows four-layer architectural framework developed at CISCO cloud IoT \nfor a city.

Services, security and city services management \nare cross-domain functions. Assume the edge sensors and devices consist of, say i -smart \ndevices, j - sensors, k -intrusion sensors and l - mobile and fixed assets and devices whereas \ni , j , k and l can be very large numbers. \n\nThe edge sensors and devices wirelessly connect within small cells, systems connect \nwith WLAN (Wireless LAN). They communicate using LPWAN. The distributed network \nof edge-computing systems connects using IP protocols or using the Multiprotocol Label \nSwitching (MPLS). The MPLS assigns the labels to data packets and forward the labels to \ncity cloud IoT platform. \n\nCity cloud IoT platform collects messages, triggers, alerts and data files at data store. \nThe platform does device and connectivity management functions, application enabler \n\n19 https://networks.nokia.com/smart-city \n\n484 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nfunctions, and data processing and analytics. The platform generates triggers which \nfollows actions, such as connect to social media, set of web services, applications, iOS apps \nand Android apps. The platform connects to a number of city applications and services. \n\nSmart city applications and services can deploy CISCO IoT, IOx and Fog. This is because \nof usages of shared networks and distributed access point nodes, and the need of an \necosystem with ability to transform sensor data and perform the control functions within \nthe distributed network nodes. This enables development of applications, such as site asset \nmanagement, energy monitoring, and smart parking infrastructure and connected cities. \n\nAlternatively, smart city solutions can deploy ThingWorx IoT platform, which is an \nintelligent management platform for all connected things (IMPACT). IMPACT platform \nprovides devices and connectivity management, application enablement, data and \nanalytics with secure end-to-end access. \n\nSensors, Devices, Hardware Edge Systems Deployment \n\nSection 7.2.2 described the sensors which can be deployed for a number of city applications. \nSection 8.3 described embedded platforms Arduino, Edison, RPi, BeagleBone and mBed \nwhich can be used for prototype development of edge systems. \n\nAn open-source prototyping platform, openHAB and hardware RPi or Arduino can \nbe deployed at the edge systems. Bosch presented at CES 2017 a prototyping platform \nfor IoT. 20 The platform connects the devices and provides a number of solutions. Edge \nhardware is Bosch XDK 110 development kit, which includes devices [eight number \nmicroelectromechanical system, accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope, coupled \nwith relative-humidity (RH), pressure (P), temperature (T), acoustic and digital light- \nsensors], functional extendibility with a 26-pin extension port, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi \nconnectivity . 21 XDK workbench includes its IDE. \n\nCode Development Environment, Development, Debugging and Deployment \n\nSection 9.3.2 described end-to-end IoT Solutions with Java and Eclipse IoT Stack. Section \n12.5.1 described openHAB software platform for devices, sensor and edge systems at a \nsmart home. Java, Eclipse IoT Stack and openHAB can be used for end-to-end solutions \nfor smart city applications and services. \n\nXDK workbench is for code development environment for the prototype kit XDK 110. \nThe workbench includes the IDE, software for all system component drivers, a debugger \nport, and high and low level APIs for sensors. The bench also includes libraries for sensor \nreadings, CoAP and LWM2M client and server, MQTT client and broker using Eclipse \nPaho connector, and HTTP client request and response server. Also included are virtual \nSDK applications for virtual mobile iOS and Android GUIs for monitoring and control of \nthe sensors and WLAN and Bluetooth LE protocol stacks. XDK provides access to XDK \ndeveloper community for online technical support. The community offers platform for \ndiscussions of ideas, exchange of information and innovation. \n\n20 http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1331136 \n21 http://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com/overview \n\nIoT Case Studies \n485 \n\nSmart City Parking \n\nA growing problem in cities is of vehicular traffic congestion and parking spaces. A modern \ncity, therefore, provides a number of multilevel parking spaces which spread all over the \ncity. A driver needs a mobile app. Significant fuel saving can result from provisioning of \nsmart parking spaces in a city. \n\nA smart parking-service should enable the following: \n1. Guides the drivers for the available parking slots and spaces \n2. Provides a mobile app, and the app assists a driver and enables him/her to obtain the \n\nappropriate parking-slot information remotely. The information includes location of \nthe parking utility, its cost, advance reservation facility, direction guidance and the \ntime to reach an available slot. The app accesses the slots availability in real-time data \nin pub/sub mode. \n3. Publishes messages in real time for available slots and alerts for slot unavailability at \n\nthe parking utility \n4. Consists of a central supervisory control and monitoring system (CSS) which connects \n\nthe edge sensors and devices, accurately senses the slots available for occupancy \nof vehicles in real time, and predicts the expected availability time in case of non- \navailability of slots \n5. Optimises the usages of parking spaces and reaching time \n6. Provides display boards at road traffic junctions for status of availability \n7. Provides good parking experience to users \n8. Adds value for all parking stakeholders, drivers and service providers \n9. Enables intelligent decisions using data and historical analytics reports at city cloud \n\ndata store, and enables planning for traffic flow in the city by predictive analytics \nSensors play vital role in the smart parking. The application is ranked as topmost among \n50 sensor-applications for a smarter world. 22 \n\nDomain Architecture Reference Model \n\nFigure 12.10 shows data-flow diagram, domains and architecture reference model for \nsmart parking applications and services. \n\nThe figure shows four layers at two domains. Parking spaces are at layer 1. They are \nsensed using coordinators at each level in multilevel parking spaces. An actuator for the \nlight at each slot is used. Lighting control module at the coordinator actuates the parking \nspace lights. The lightings can be switched on and off as per requirement for each space. \n\nA Parking Assistance System (PAS) is at layer 2. This includes CCS and three modules \nfor monitoring, control and display. Layers 1 and 2 communication protocols are ZigBee, \nLWM2M and UDP. \n\nThe CSS maintains a real-time database of time-series data of the parking spaces. The \nsystem connects layer 3, which includes the SMS gateway and cloud IoT platform. \n\n22 http://www.libelium.com/resources/top_50_iot_sensor_applications_ranking/ \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p512_i0.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p512_i1.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p512_i2.png)\n486 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nParking Area \n\nTrigger and Actions \n\nApps \n\nCity Cloud IoT Platform \n\nZigBee  network for coordinators \n\nSMS Service \n\nApps Store \n\nLayer 1 \nLayer 2 \nLayer 3 \nLayer 4 \n\nCity Parking Spaces and \n\nGateways Domain \n\nShared Network, Cloud, IoT Platform \n\nand Parking Applications Domain \n\nParking Services, Security \nand Services Management \n\nUltrasonic \nSensors at \nMultilevel \n\nParking \n\nSpaces \n\nParking \n\nspaces \n1,\u2026, i \n\nParking \n\nspaces \n1,\u2026, j \n\nParking \nspaces \n1,\u2026, k \n\nParking \n\nspaces \n1,\u2026.., l \n\nUDP connected \n\nCentralised \nSupervisory \n\nSystem and \nConnectivity \nManagement \n\nSpace \nmonitoring, \n\nControl \ncommands for \n\nactuators at \neach lighting \n\nand Display \n\nmodules at \nparking spaces \n\nReal-time \n\nDatabase \n\nDevice \nManagement \n\nWi-Fi, HTTP, HTTPS, Wi-Fi Services \n\nDirection \nand route, \nSlot number \n\nallotted, \nParked time \n\nand Billing \ninformation \n\nAndroid \n\nApps \n\niOS  Apps \n\nPayment \nGateway \n\nParking Areas \n\nManagement \n\nConnectivity \nManagement \n\nData Processing and \n\nData Analytics \n\nData Store \n\nSet of Web \nServices and \nApplications \n\nFigure 12.10 Data flow diagram, domain architecture reference model and four layers for the design of \n\nsmart parking applications and services \n\nLayer 2 connects CSS with all coordinators. Layer 2 includes a real-time time-series \ndatabase. Layer 2 also connects with three modules for (i) displaying, (ii) space monitoring \nand (iii) control commands for actuators for each parking slot. \n\nLayer 3 consists of SMS gateway and City cloud IoT platform that connects CSS, modules \nand database using the Wi-Fi, HTTP and HTTPS services. The platform has data store, \ndata processing and analytics, and parking areas and connectivity management modules. \n\nThe CSS sends the UDP packets using MPLS and uses a SMS service to communicate \nwith the mobile app. The SMS service communicates parking information. A packet \nprovides information such as slot available, slot allocated, time parked, billing information \nand directional and parking space route details to the user\u2019s mobile phone \n\nThe user downloads a PAS app from the App store. The user\u2019s mobile also connects to \na payment gateway for parking service bill payment. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p513_i0.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p513_i1.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p513_i2.png)\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p513_i3.png)\nIoT Case Studies \n487 \n\nLayer 4 web services connect the cloud data store, and use the PaaS cloud for the \nanalytics. \n\nHardware Prototype Development and Deployment \n\nSection 7.2.2 described sensors for ultrasonic pulse detectors. When a car parking slot is \noccupied, then the parked car reflects back ultrasonic pulses to the source. The sensor \nmeasures the reflected directional intensity and delay period for the reflections. The \nadvantage of ultrasonic waves is that the distance and therefore, identification of reflector \ncar surface is also found from the delay in reflected pulses. \n\nThe coordinator updates the parked slots status on each alert from a circuit. The sensor \nassociated circuit at coordinator alerts the CSS for status change and generates time-series \nmessages from the sensor data and communicates to the CSS for saving at the real-time \ndatabase. \n\nFigure 12.11 shows the design principle for a set up for identifying vacant spaces \nand slot IDs using ultrasonic pulses and back reflections to the transceiver (emitter and \nsensors) at the coordinator. \n\nZigBee Communication \n\nOccupied Slot \n\nOccupied Slot \n\nVacant Slot \nCentral \nSupervisory \n\nSystem \n\nVacant Slot \n\nCoordinator with \n\nultrasonic pulse \nemitters and array of \n\nsensor circuits \n\nOccupied Slot \n\ninvisible \n\nOccupied Slot \n\ninvisible \n\nFigure 12.11 Design principle for the set up for identifying vacant spaces using ultrasonic pulses and \n\nback reflections from cars to the transceiver at the coordinator \n\n488 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nAssume that a set of four coordinators each are placed at each level. A coordinator \nconsists of a transceiver, which emits ultrasonic pulses and receives reflected signals using \nan array of sensors. Sensors have associated circuits at each level of parking. Assume that \neach transceiver\u2019s-coverage area at each coordinator spans to one fourth of the slots at that \nlevel. Therefore, total sixteen coordinators are located at four levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. Four \ncoordinators at level 1 are C i1 , C i2 , C i3 and C i4 , four at level 2 are C j1 , C j2 , C j3 and C i4 , four at \nlevel 3 are C k1 , C k2 , C k3 and C k4 and four at level 4 are C l1 , C l2 , C l3 and C l4 . \n\nThe coordinators process the status information and time-series data transmits to CSS. \nThe CSS receives information of parking slots from the coordinators as UDP datagram. \nCSS then relays the parking information to city-cloud platform data-store and to users, \nwhich seeks that from mobiles or card dashboard computer. Each coordinator sends all \nmessages with slot ID and observation instances onto the ZigBee network as time-series \ndata. A real-time database updates at regular intervals, say of 1 m each. \n\nThe edge sensors and devices wirelessly connect within small cells, systems connect with \nZigBee. They communicate using LPWAN. The distributed network of edge-computing \nsystems connects using IP protocols or using the Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). \nThe MPLS assigns the labels to data packets and forward the labels to City cloud IoT- \nplatform. \n\nCode Development Environment, Development, Debugging and Deployment \n\nSection 9.3.2 described end-to-end IoT Solutions with Java and Eclipse IoT Stack. Section \n12.5.1 described openHAB software platform for devices, sensor and edge systems at a \nsmart home. Java, Eclipse IoT Stack and openHAB can be used for end-to-end solutions \nfor each parking utility in the city. \n\nSmart city parking solutions can also be developed using the intelligent management \nplatform IMPACT. \n\n12.5.3 Smart Environment-Monitoring \n\nEnvironment monitoring refers to actions that are required for characterising and \nmonitoring the quality of the environment. A smart environment monitoring system \nshould enable the following: \n\n1. Preparations for assessment of environment impact \n2. Establish the trends in environmental parameters and current status of the \n\nenvironment \n3. Interpretation of data and evaluate environmental quality indices \n4. Monitor the air, soil and water quality parameters \n5. Monitor harmful chemicals, biological, microbiological, radiological and other \n\nparameters \n\nIoT Case Studies \n489 \n\nWeather Monitoring System \n\nA smart weather monitoring system should enable the following: \n\n1. Each measuring node for weather parameters is assigned \n\nan ID. Each lamppost deploys a wireless sensor node. Each \nnode measure the T, RH and other weather parameters at \nassigned locations. A group of WSNs communicates using \nZigBee and forms a network. Each network has an access \npoint, which receives the messages from each node. Figures \n7.17 and 7.18 depicted the WSNs. They depicted interconnections between nodes, \ncoordinators, routers and access points. Each access point associates a gateway. \n2. The nodes communicate the parameters up to the access point using WSNs at \n\nmultiple locations. \n3. Forward and store the parameters on an Internet cloud platform \n4. Publishes weather messages for the display boards at specific locations in the city \n\nand communicates to weather API at mobile and web users \n5. Publishes the messages in real time and send alerts using a weather reporting \n\napplication \n6. Analyse and assess the environment impact \n7. Enables intelligent decisions using data and historical analytics reports at city cloud \n\nweather data store \nTwo domains and their high-level service capabilities in the weather monitoring services \nin IoT architecture reference model are: \n\n1. Device and Gateway Domain : Assume that the system deploys m weather-sensor \n\nembedded devices, each with a location-data sensor and n access-points for the WSNs. \nA sensor node does minimum required computations, gathers sensed information \nand communicates with other connected nodes in the network. 23 \n\nmain computations and puts the result in real time updated database.

The weather monitoring circuit deploys \nsensors for T, RH and atmospheric pressure (P atm ) and may include solar visible radiation, \nwind speed and direction, and rainfall. \n\nIoT Case Studies \n491 \n\nHardware design of the sensor and WSN node can use Arduino board with ZigBee \nshield. Alternatively Waspmote, an open source wireless sensor platform for autonomous \nwireless low power including WSN nodes, called MOTEs (mobile terminals). Waspmote \nnode battery power can be between 1 year and 5 years depending on the transceiver, \nfrequency and the radio used. The platform is compatible with the Arduino IDE and has \na community support. \n\nThe edge devices and WSNs codes development uses IDE such as the Arduino or \nEclipse IDE (Section 9.3.1) for Java Developers. \n\nWeather Reporting Bot \n\nA bot is an application that runs automated or semi-automated \nscripts a for specific set of tasks and communicates the results \nover the Internet. 25 A bot generally performs the task which are \nsimple and structurally repetitive, such as a, weather reporting \nbot. The word \u2018bot\u2019 is derided from the word robot . \n\nA bot can communicate with an API using Instant Messaging (IM) or Internet Relay Chat \n(IRC) or to Twitter or Facebook. A bot can also chat and give responses to the questions \nfrom user API. \n\nA widely used bot is an application in which the script fetches, analyses and files \ninformation from a web server. A server may specify in a text file, called robots.txt for \nrules on bot behaviour on that server. A server can use software to deny access in case the \nscript does not observe the rules specified at the file. \n\nA weather bot is multitasking. That can be used to communicate a report on a mobile. \nThe bot fetches, analyses and communicates information to a report seeking API. The \nbot uses the weather parameters and generates the alert messages from the database and \nmessages for forecast by a cloud analytics service. \n\nA mobile app can display the report in two succeeding frames repeatedly. The first \nframe shows the weather condition of the current day, as: \n\n1. First line: condition such as clear, rain, partly rain, cloudy or partly cloudy \n2. Second line, first part text gives the day current T and four or five spaces \n3. Second line, second part text gives superscripted text for the maximum T expected \n\nand subscripted text for minimum T expected, followed by four or five spaces \n4. Second line, third part text gives superscripted text for current RH% value and \n\nsubscripted text for wind-speed in kmph (kilometer per hour). \nThus, first reporting frame displays the current condition and day\u2019s forecast for T max \nand T min . Second frame shows the forecast for today, tomorrow and day after for weather \nas: \n\n1. First line: \u201cSat Sun Mon\u201d \n2. Second line shows a symbol which is completely unfilled circle for sunny, or cloud \n\nimage with sun for partly cloudy, or cloud sign for fully cloudy below each day \n\n25 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot \n\nUses of weather \nbots for autonomous \n\nweather reporting \n\nservice \n\n492 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSat, Sun and Mon. After the sign, a superscripted word gives maximum T , and a \nsubscripted word, the minimum expected on that day. \nThus, forecast for three days is reported, viz. today, tomorrow and day after. \nExample of creating a weather bot is Slackweatherbot API. 26 The bot uses the codes \ngiven a Farnciskim site. 27 The API is a node.js module for the bot. It displays Second frame \nshows the forecast for today, tomorrow and day after days for weather, for example as \nfollows: \n\n1. First line: Bot name Current Runtime (such as 09:15 A.M.) \n2. Second line shows \u201cCondition for City Name , Place Name , Current Time , Standard (such \n\nas IST, GMT) \n3. Third line shows \u201cToday (such as SAT): T , condition (such as sunny, partly cloudy, \n\ncloudy or rain)\u201d \n4. Fourth line shows \u201cTomorrow (such as SUN) Current: T , condition \u201d \n5. Fifth line shows \u201cDay after (such as MON) Current: T , condition \u201d \n\nAir Pollution Monitoring \n\nA growing problem for all residents is air pollution from cars, \ntoxic gases generated in factories and farms, such as carbon \nmonoxide (CO). Pollution needs monitoring and to ensure \nthe safety of workers and goods inside chemical plants. The \nmonitoring does the following tasks: \n\n1. Monitoring and measuring levels of CO, a gas dangerous \n\nabove 50\u2013100 ppm level; carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a gas causes \nwhich greenhouse effect; and ozone (O 3 ), a gas dangerous \nabove 0.1 mg/per kg air level, for controlling air pollution \n2. Monitoring and measuring levels of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), a highly toxic gas. It is a \n\ngreenhouse gas so its increase may contribute to global warming as well. \n3. Monitoring and measuring levels of hydrocarbons, such as ethanol, propane. \n4. Measure T, RH and P atm parameters for calibrations of sensed gaseous parameters of \n\neach node \n5. Investigate air quality and the effects of air pollution. \n6. Compute Air Quality Index (AQI) from the parameters, such as hourly or daily \n\naverages of air pollutant concentration, particulate matter (such as dust or carbon \nparticle) \n7. Compute source and spatial dispersion of pollutants as a function of day conditions, \n\nwind-speed and direction, air temperature and air temperature gradient with altitude \nand topography using analytics. \n8. Data visualisation \n9. Report the pollution status to monitoring authorities \n\n26 https://github.com/franciskim/Slackweatherbot \n27 https://franciskim.co/how-to-create-a-weather-bot-for-slack-chat/ \n\nUses of sensors for CO, \nCO 2 and T, RH and P atm \n\nparameters, WSNs, \naccess points, gateways \n\nand a cloud platform \nfor smart air pollution \n\nmonitoring service \n\nIoT Case Studies \n493 \n\nSensors play a vital role in air-quality monitoring. The application has eleventh ranking \namong 50 sensor-applications for a smarter world. 22 \n\nA data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for air pollution \nmonitoring services are similar to Figure 12.12. Two domains and their high-level service \ncapabilities in the air quality and pollution monitoring services in IoT architecture \nreference model are: \n\n1. Device and Gateway Domain : Assume that the system deploys m gas sensor embedded \n\ndevices at each WSN with a location-data sensor and n access-points for the WSNs \n(Figures 7.17 and 7.18). The data-adaptation layer at gateway does the aggregation, \ncompaction and fusion computations for each sensor node data. The queries gather \nsensed information from the database and the items selected communicate using \nHTTP/HTTPS/MPLS services. \n\nWSN board IO ports connect the sensors for gaseous, particulate matter and \nweather parameters. Each sensor node is configured by assigning a node ID. A \nnode ID maps with the GPS location found earlier from GPS modules at the data- \nadaptation layer at the gateway. \n\nis also configured for frequency of measurements every day and interval between \ntwo successive measurements. The sensor circuit is configured to activate only for \nmeasurement duration at a measuring instance followed by long inactive intervals. \n\ncoefficients of the temperature sensor. Refer Example 9.6 which gives the codes for \nuses of the calibration coefficients of sensed data communicated by I2C serial bus. \nThe coefficients enable to sense parameters with enhanced accuracy. \n\natm (THP). \nTherefore, these parameters are also measured along with gas sensor outputs. \nMapping of a sensor output with the THP coefficients at the adaptation layer will \nresult into accuracy in the measurements of values of sensed parameters. \n\n24 which can be used with sensors such as city \npollution CO, NO, NO 2 , O 3 , SO 2 and dust particles sensors and air-quality finding \nsensors for SO 2 , NO 2 , dust particles, CO, CO 2 , O 3 and NH 3 . The Arduino or Eclipse \nIDE can be used to develop codes for the Waspmote. \n2. The Applications and Network Domain: The applications and network domain deploys the \n\napplications and services and have high-level capabilities, such as events, messages, \nalerts and data processing, databases, applications and \nservices, analytics, data visualisation, display-board feeds, \npollution reporting applications and services, and IFTTT \ntriggers and actions. The cloud platform can be TCUP, AWS \nIoT, IBM Bluemix or Nimbits. \n\nForest Fire Detection \n\nA big problem for countries with large forest areas is forest fires. \nA fire monitoring service does the following tasks: \n\nUses of sensors for \nT, RH, CO, CO 2 and \ninfrared light, WSNs, \nalarm algorithm, access \n\npoints, gateways, real \n\ntime analytics and \ncloud platform for smart \nforest-fire detection and \n\nmapping of affected \n\nareas \n\n494 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n1. Uses OTP features for programmable WSNs and gateways \n2. Measures and monitors the T, RH, CO, CO 2 and infrared light (fire generated) \n\nintensity in real time at preset intervals \n3. Each WSN uploads the program and preset measured intervals of t1 (say, 300 s) each \n\nand the preset measured intervals of t2 (say, on 1 or 5 s) on sensed parameters values \nexceeding thresholds can instantaneously trigger the fire-alarm algorithm \n4. Configures the data-adaptation layers with calibration parameters \n5. Communicates the WSN messages at the preset intervals to the access point associated \n\nfor specific network area \n6. Communicates alerts, triggers, messages and data at data-adaptation layer using an \n\nuploaded program at associated gateway \n7. Uploads connectivity programs for gateways \n8. Runs at the data-adaptation layer the faulty or inaccessible sensors at periodic \n\nintervals \n9. Integrates data with the node locations found from mapping with node IDs, compute, \n\nand activate the alarms using an algorithm, input-sensed and calibrated coefficients \n10. Processes the layer data and database information, and communicates instantaneously \n\nto nearest mobiles and fire-fighting services near the access point gateway \n11. Updates the database and communicates to a cloud platform, such as Nimbits, \n\nmy.openHAB, TCUP, AWS or Bluemix platform \n12. Modifies the preset measured intervals to t2 on activation of the fire alarm after value \n\nchanges above the configured threshold values \n13. Uses analytics to evaluate reliability index of the preset, threshold and configuration \n\nvalues and need to update alarm-algorithm and if needs improvement then upload \nnew algorithms \n14. Uses analytics to generate and communicate topological maps for the currently fire- \n\ninfected forest area and reachability maps for fire-fighting service equipments \nSensors play a vital role in forest-fire monitoring. The application has tenth ranking \namong 50 sensor-applications for a smarter world. 22 Products \n\nFigure 12.13 shows a data-flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for \nthe monitoring service. \n\nThe figure shows that the service deploys m embedded-sensor devices at each of n \nWSN associated with x access points. Device and gateway domain functions in the fire \nmonitoring service for forests in IoT architecture reference model is as follows: \n\nA lookup table enables mapping of two entities. Location-data stamping uses sensor \n\nIDs at a lookup table. Data adaptation of each sensor is at the layer. Data aggregates, \ncompacts and fuses, computes, gathers sensed information and the algorithms use \nthat for alarm and faulty sensor identification and configuration management. Data \nstore at the database, updates in real time. The alerts and messages communicate to \nIoT cloud platform. \n\nHardware WSN board and sensors can use Waspmote board. 24 Each WSN \n\ncommunicates to access points using a multiprotocol wireless router. \n\nIoT Case Studies \n495 \n\nHTTP/ HTTPS Service \n\nDevice and Gateway Domain \n\nItem Provider \n\nMobile \n\nApplets (Trigger \n\nand Actions) \n\nApplications \n\nIFTTT \n\nData Visualisation \n\nDatabase \n\nApplications and Network Domain \n\nCloud platform for forest fire \n\nmonitoring services \nSensor \nEmbedded \n\nDevices \n1,\u2026, m at \n\nWSN \nnodes \n1,\u2026, n \n\n6LowPAN/ \nIPv6 Interfaces \n\nSensor WSNs \n\nAccess Point \n\n1, .., x \n\nSmall Cells/ZigBee LAN/ \nLPWANand Multiprotocol \n\nWireless Router \n\nAlarm-Activation \n\nFaulty-device \n\nIdentification \nData Adaptation \n\nLayer \n\nProtocol \nBindings \n\nTime and Location \n\nStamping Service \n\nOSGi \nFramework \n\nFire Service \n\nNeeded \nAlarms \n\nAlerts, \nMessages \n\nData \nProcessing \n\nDevice and \n\nCommuni- \n\ncation \nManagement \n\nParameters, \n\nAlerts and \n\nMessages \nData Store \n\nFire Area Topology, \n\nContour and Map \n\nAnalytics \n\nEvents, \nMessages \nand Alerts \n\nOTP and Updates \n\nManagement \n\nDisplay \nBoards \n\nCentralised \n\nFire \nServices \n\ne-Mail \n\nSocial \nMedia \n\nFigure 12.13 Data flow diagram and domain architecture reference model for the WSNs based Forest \n\nFire monitoring service \n\n12.5.4 Smart Agriculture \n\nFollowing section describes two applications viz., smart irrigation in crop fields and smart \nwine quality enhancing. \n\nSmart Irrigation \n\nSmart irrigation deploys sensors for moisture. A smart irrigation \nmonitoring service does the following tasks: \n\n1. Sensors for moisture and actuators for watering channels \n\nare used in smart irrigation. \n2. Uses soil moisture sensors with a sensor circuitry board \n\nwith each one  installed at certain depth in the fields. \n3. Uses an array of actuators (solenoid valves) which are \n\nplaced along the water channels and that control deficiencies in moisture levels \nabove thresholds during a given crop period. \n4. Uses sensors placed at three depths for monitoring of moisture in fruit plants such as \n\ngrapes or mango, and monitors evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) \n5. Measures and monitors actual absorption and irrigation water needs \n6. Each sensor board is in a waterproof cover and communicates to an access point \n\nusing ZigBee protocol. An array of sensor circuits forms a WSN. \n\nUses of soil moisture \nsensors, actuators for \nwater channels, WSNs, \nLPWAN, access points, \n\ngateway and cloud \n\nplatform for smart \n\nirrigation \n\n496 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n7. Access point receives the data and transfers it to an associated gateway. Data adapts \n\nat the gateway and then communicates to a cloud platform using LPWAN. \n8. The cloud platform may be deployed such as Nimbits, my.openHAB, AWS or \n\nBluemix. \n9. Analytics at the platform analyses the moisture data and communicates to the \n\nactuators of water irrigation channels as per the water needs and past historical data \n10. Measurements at the sensors are at preset intervals and actuators activate at analysed \n\nrequired values of the intervals. \n11. The platform uploads the programs to sensors and actuators circuitry and sets preset \n\nmeasurement intervals of T1 (say, 24 hour) each and the preset actuation interval of \nt2 (say, on 120 hour) \n12. Sensed moisture values when exceed preset thresholds then trigger the alarm \n13. An algorithm uploads and updates the programs for the gateways and nodes. \n14. Runs at the data-adaptation layer and finds the faulty or inaccessible moisture \n\nsensors at periodic intervals \n15. Open source SDK and IDE are used for prototyping the monitoring system. \n\nSmart Wine Quality Enhancing \n\nThe sensors monitor the soil moisture and trunk diameter in vineyards. The monitoring \ncontrols the sugar content in grapes and health of grapevines. \n\nData-flow diagram and domain architecture reference-model for the monitoring service \nare similar to ones shown in Figure 12.12. \n\nDevice and Gateway Domain \n\nA WSN measures moisture and other parameters and has an ID. Each node is a WSN. Each \nWSN measures at assigned places in a crop or vineyard at certain depth(s) inside the soil. \nSensors at three equally spaced depths are used for the vineyard grapes sugar-control. \nA group of WSNs communicate among themselves using ZigBee and form a network. \nEach network has an access point, which receives the messages from each node using \nLPWAN. Figures 7.17 and 7.18 show the WSNs. They show interconnections between \nnodes, coordinators, routers and access points. Each access point associates a gateway. \nEach gateway communicates to the cloud using LPWAN. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf Prototypes for applications and services can be developed using the data-flow diagram, two-domain \nfour-layers architectural reference model. Design of smart applications and services need designing \nand prototype development for the four architectural layers: (i) sensor and device networks, \n(ii) data adaptation and gateway, (iii) cloud platform, which includes data store and analytics, and \n(iv) applications and services. \n\n\u25cf IDE (layer 1) is used for programming the sensors and devices. \n\n\u25cf ZigBee, 6LowPAN, IPv6, WLAN and LPWAN are used for communication from sensor and device \nnetworks. \n\nIoT Case Studies \n497 \n\n\u25cf Eclipse IoT stack and OSGi services (layers 1 and 2) can be used for Java programming at architectural \nlayers 1 and 2. \n\n\u25cf An access point receives the data and transfers it to the associated gateway. Data adapts at the \ngateway and then communicates to a cloud platform using LPWAN. \n\n\u25cf A cloud platform (layer 3), such as Nimbits, my.openHAB, AWS, Bluemix or TCS CUP, is deployed for \nprocessing the messages, events, alerts, triggers and data and storing, analytics, and visualising the \nresults, and using the platform-specific features. \n\n\u25cf Applications, services and Mobile apps (layer 4) enable a number of services using the cloud. \n\n\u25cf Illustrative examples of numerous IoT applications and services are smart homes, smart cities, smart \nenvironment monitoring and smart agriculture. \n\n\u25cf Smart home services enable home-lighting control, control and monitoring of appliances, security, \nintrusion detection, video surveillance, access control and security alerts, Wi-Fi, Internet and remote \ncloud access for control and monitoring. \n\n\u25cf An open source openHAB is the development environment and deployment platform. The platform \nis neutral to hardware and interfacing protocols. For example, a security camera device may be on \nRaspberry platform and lighting devices on Arduino. The automation logics can connect different \nsystems. \n\n\u25cf A cloud platform is my.openHAB. The my.openHAB cloud connector also includes REST and cloud \nbased services, such as IFTTT. \n\n\u25cf IFTTT service enables a developer to create a sequential set of conditional (If This Then That) \nstatements, called applets, which trigger actions by change to other web-service, such as Facebook, \nTwitter, Gmail. APIs of the application control the actions using the triggers. \n\n\u25cf Smart city integrates multiple ICT and IoT solutions in a secure fashion to manage a city\u2019s assets, \nsuch as information systems, schools, libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, \nwater-supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, and other community services . \n\n\u25cf Smart city edge sensors and devices wirelessly connect, and networks of the devices communicate \nusing LPWAN, the systems connect using IP protocols or using the Multiprotocol Label Switching \n(MPLS). \n\n\u25cf Smart city solutions can deploy CISCO IoT cloud. Alternative is ThingWorx IoT platform for intelligent \nmanagement of things. City cloud IoT platform collects messages, triggers, alerts and data files at \ndata store. The platform uses events, triggers and data store and analytics. The platform connects to \na number of city applications and services, and triggers the actions, such as connect to social media, \nset of web services, applications and mobiles apps. \n\n\u25cf Smart parking service is a city service, which guides the drivers to the vacant parking slots and \nspaces, and also provides a mobile app. The app assists a driver and enables the driver to obtain \nappropriate parking-slot information remotely. \n\n\u25cf Smart environment monitoring refers to actions that are required for characterising and monitoring \nthe quality of environment, such as air, soil and water. \n\n\u25cf Weather-monitoring systems measure the T, RH, P and other weather parameters; communicate \nthose using WSNs at multiple areas, which communicate up to the access points and associated \ngateways. The gateway adapts, stores and forwards the parameters to the Internet cloud platform. \n\n\u25cf Weather-monitoring service publishes weather-messages for display boards at specific locations in \nthe city and communicates to weather APIs at mobiles and web users. \n\n\u25cf A bot fetches analyses and communicates server information repeatedly for the report-seeking \nAPIs. The bots communicate the reports on a mobile app or web application. A weather-bot is a \nmultitasking JavaScript or node.js scripts for the weather reports autonomously. \n\n498 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n\u25cf Smart air-pollution monitoring-service measures the levels of CO, CO 2 , particulate matter and other \nparameters. The service computes AQI from the parameters, such as, hourly or daily averages of air \npollutant concentration and particulate matter (such as dust or carbon particle) \n\n\u25cf The service computes source and spatial dispersion of pollutants as a function of day conditions, \nwind-speed and direction, air temperature and air temperature \n\n\u25cf Smart forest fire monitoring service deploys number of network of WSNs, interconnected access \npoints and associated gateways. The gateways connect with Internet cloud platform enables forest \nfire detection and map the affected area. \n\n\u25cf Smart irrigation deploys sensors for moisture at a depth in the crop fields and actuators for watering \nchannels. Smart quality monitoring deploys sensors placed at three depths for monitoring of moisture \nin fruit plants such as vineyard or mango, and monitors evaporation and transpiration. \n\n\u25cf Smart irrigation controls deficiencies in moisture levels above thresholds during a given crop-period. \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

A lamppost hosts \na streetlight, WSN actuator and sensors. The sensors enable \nmessages for lamp functioning status, ambient light and traffic. The actuator enables \nswitching the lights on and off. \n\nWhen ambient light is above threshold, then the lights are switched on. The WSN \ndeploy sensors for detecting traffic presence and traffic density so that when traffic is not \npresent, then lights are switched off. This results in saving of energy. The traffic density \nmessages communicate to traffic-signal monitoring service. \n\nThe WSN transceiver can also accept data from other services, such as Wi-Fi service, \nsecurity service or traffic signalling service and retransmit onto the network of WSNs and \nthen to access points. City services can deploy lampposts in streetlighting systems as \ninformation networks. A lamppost can be an active node in the services network. \n\nEach transceiver at the lamppost can receive and retransmit \nin real time. Events, messages, alerts, triggers and notifications \nfrom a number of services can transmit for services such as \nsmart parking, traffic signalling, waste management, air-quality \nindex monitoring services, security services for home, banks and \nimportant public places, emergency services and hospitals. \n\nA control and monitoring service for city streetlights does the \nfollowing tasks: \n\n1. Measures and monitors the streetlights and measures traffic parameters in real time \n\nat preset intervals \n2.

The n WSN node networks \ncommunicate between them using ZigBee/6LowPAN/IPv6 protocol. The city streetlight \nservice deploys x coordinators. Each network communicates with a coordinator using \nLPWAN or ZigBee IP wireless interfaces. Coordinator functions as data store, protocol \nbinder, item provider and gateway. \n\nEach lamppost deploys a WSN. Each node senses a set of sensors data. Sensor circuits \ncan deploy Arduino boards with ZigBee or ZigBee IP shields. Each WSN interfaces with \nother WSNs and forms a network of ZigBee devices. \n\nA WSN measures the following parameters: (i) ambient light condition, whether above \nor below a preset threshold, (ii) presence or absence of traffic in vicinity, (iii) traffic density \nand (iv) lamppost status, whether non-functional or not \n\nEach lamppost need not measure traffic parameters. Each WSN configures the sensing \ndevices so that a measurement activates or deactivates as per commands from the \ncoordinator and central monitor service. Configuring the node enables each parameter \nmeasurement at different preset intervals. Each WSN configures the actuator for enabling \nthe lights on and off as per commands. \n\nA group of WSNs communicate among themselves using ZigBee and form a network. \nEach network has an access point, which receives the messages from each node using \nLPWAN. Figures 7.17 and 7.18 show the WSNs. They show interconnections between \nnodes, coordinators, routers and access points. Each access point associates a gateway. \nEach gateway communicates to the cloud using LPWAN. \n\nSoftware \n\nOpen source IDE or Eclipse IoT stack which include OSGi can be used for software \ndevelopment at devices and gateway domain. \n\nEach WSN is assigned sensor-IDs, lamppost-ID, lane-ID, subgroup-ID (left and right \nsides traffic). A subgroup of wireless sensor nodes form a WSN network and an assigned \nnetwork-ID. Each coordinator is assigned a coordinator-ID. \n\nEach coordinator has three modules: (i) protocol binding module, (ii) item provider \nmodule for communication of queried items, alerts, messages and data, and (iii) time, \nlamppost ID, lane ID and location stamping service. The coordinator can use an open \nsource OSGi framework for Java codes. A database at coordinator stores in associated \nstreetlights, lanes and lane subgroups data. \n\nApplications and Network Domain \n\nCloud platform for city streetlight monitoring service deploys a number of distributed \nnodes. Internet connectivity is using HTTP/HTTPS service. The IP protocol network \n\n502 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nrouters connect each coordinator with a distributed node. The distributed node platform \nprovides the: \n\n(i) Alerts, messages and data processing module \n(ii) Devices network and communication management module \n(iii) Analytics tools for traffic, streetlights and other parameters \n(iv) Data store for parameters, alerts and messages \n\n(v) AI tools \n(vi) Data visualisation tools \n(vii) Coordinators, networks and nodes update management using OTP \n(viii) Event messages, triggers and alerts for central control and monitoring services \n\n(ix) IFTTT for communication to mobile, e-mail, social media and web services and \n\napplications. \n\n12.6.1 Streetlights Control and Monitoring Coding Examples \n\nFollowing are the examples of communication of parameters from a lamppost to the \ncoordinator in Java. 28 \n\nClass Main \n\npackage com.main.execution.files;

Each streetlight lamppost MQTT client transfers the data to an MQTT broker. \nA coordinator also includes a MQTT client and subscribes for the sensed data of each \nlamppost. Each lamppost includes the MQTT broker to receive the sensed data from \nthe host lamppost and the neighbouring lampposts. Example 9.11 codes can be used for \ncoding for the communication between lampposts and the coordinator. \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf An application of Internet of Things concept is smart streetlights in the city. A lamppost can be an \nactive node in the services network. City services can deploy lampposts at the street lighting systems \nas information network for security services for home, banks and public installations, hospitals, \nparking spaces, waste container management. \n\n\u25cf Each lamppost for street lighting functions as a WSN. Each WSN interfaces with other WSNs and \nforms a network of ZigBee devices. \n\n\u25cf The sensors at WSN measure the following parameters: (i) ambient light condition, whether above \nor below a preset threshold, (ii) presence or absence of traffic in vicinity, (iii) traffic density and \n(iv) lamppost status, whether non-functional or not \n\n\u25cf Each lamppost communicates to a coordinator serving a lane in the city road network. \n\n\u25cf ZigBee, 6LowPAN, IPv6, WLAN and LPWAN are used for communication from sensor and device \nnetworks. Eclipse IoT stack and OSGi services (layers 1 and 2) can be used for Java programming at \narchitectural layers 1 and 2. \n\n\u25cf Each access point receives the data and transfers it to an associated gateway. Data adapts at the \ngateway and is saved in the server database. The database communicates with a cloud platform \nusing LPWAN. \n\n\u25cf A distributed node cloud platform (layer 3) deploys cloud such as CISCO IoT, AWS, Bluemix or \nTCS CUP for processing the messages, events, alerts, triggers, data and storing, analytics, AI and \nvisualising tools. \n\n\u25cf Central control and monitoring service applications use the cloud data store and results of events \nprocessing. \n\n\u25cf Examples of Java coding for communication of lamppost status and parameters to the coordinator \nare given. The codes can be used for development of full set of codes. \n\n508 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.
