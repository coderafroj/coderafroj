Physical objects or things embedded with electronics, software and sensors connect to the Internet. They communicate data to applications and services. IoT enables achieving greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, operator and connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through a computing system embedded into that and each system is able to interoperate within the existing Internet infrastructure. \n\nRecall the examples of applications of IoT or M2M systems from the previous chapters. Examples were given for applications and services for streetlights, smart homes, and traffic signalling control and monitoring, ATMs, automatic chocolate vending machines, predictive analytics and maintenance of vehicles, parking and waste container management services. \n\nEach system needs electronic circuits for computation and communication. The circuits use the sensors and actuator devices, which embed the computing hardware and software. An embedded device means a device, which embeds software into a computing platform and performs the computations and communication for specific systems. \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 293 \n\n8.1 INTRODUCTION \n\nRefer to IoT and M2M architecture concepts (Section 1.3). Devices generate data. The data is generated using embedded devices, sensors and systems at the physical layer. The data needs computations at a data-adaptation gateway. Enriched data communicates through the Internet for analytics, visualisation, knowledge discovery, applications and services. \n\nA system needs electronic circuits for computation and communication. The circuits use sensors and actuator devices, which embed the computing hardware and software. Prototyping and designing require the embedded device platforms for data generation. This also requires connectivity to the Internet through computations, adaptation and networking. The software at application and application-support layer monitor and control the embedded devices, systems and machines using the actuators at the devices. \n\nFollowing are some key terms, which need to be understood when learning principles of prototype designing for creating the devices for IoTs and M2M applications: \n\nEmbedded system denotes a system that embeds software into a computing platform. The system is dedicated for either an application(s), specific part of an application, product or a component of a large system. \n\nEmbedded device refers to a device, which embeds software into a computing platform and performs the computations and communication for specific systems. \n\nMicrocontroller unit (MCU) means a single-chip VLSI unit (also called microcomputer), which may be having limited computational capabilities. The MCU possesses memory, flash, enhanced input-output capabilities and a number of on-chip functional units. \n\nTimer refers to a device which enables initiating new action(s) on timer start, on the clock inputs, time outs or when the number of clock inputs equal to a preset value. \n\nPort refers to a device that enables input output (IO) communication between the MCU and another device such as a sensor or actuator or keypad or with an external computing device. \n\nUSB port connects the device hardware to a computer, downloads the developed codes into the device from the computer, or sends the codes from the device to the computer. USB port can also provide the power for charging the battery of the connected platform, thus an external charger is not needed. \n\nGPIO pins refer to General Purpose Input-Output pins. A pin that can be used in addition to digital input and output for other purposes, such as Rx and Tx or SDA and SCK, PWMs, analog inputs, outputs or timer outputs. The Rx and Tx pins are used during UART protocol-based reception and transmission, SDA and SCK are used during use of I2C protocol-based serial data and clock communication. \n\n294 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nBoard is an electronic hardware\u2014an electronic circuit board with MCU or SoC, circuits and connectors, which provide the connections to other ICs and circuit components. The ICs and circuit components can also be inserted or joined or put in place onto the board, by surface mount technology. The board may also have battery, power supply, voltage regulator or connections for the power. \n\nPlatform denotes a set consisting of computing and communication hardware, software and operating system (OS). A platform enables working with different software, APIs, IDE and middleware. A platform may enable the development of codes at the development stage. It may also enable prototype development for an application(s) or specific parts of an application. \n\nModule (hardware) is smaller form-factor hardware which can be placed onto a board. The module may embed the software. It may enable use of the board circuit with shorter form factor. An example is RF module placed onto an electronic board. \n\nShield means a supporting circuit with connection pins, socket(s) and supporting software. The supporting circuit enables the connectivity of a board or computing platform to external circuits. The circuit connects the elements that can be plugged onto a board or platform. Usage of the supporting circuit provides extra features, such as connectivity to wireless devices, such as ZigBee, ZigBee IP, and Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi or GSM or RF module or to a wired device, such as Ethernet shield. The Ethernet shield enables wired connection of a platform to the Ethernet controller and through an external standard LAN socket enables connectivity to a wired or Wi-Fi modem for the Internet. Shield is the term used in Arduino hardware for the supporting circuits. \n\nHeader means plastic-coated strip or plastic-capped plug-in which is placed on top of the pin holes when making connection of the wires without electronic soldering. A header also provides jumpers. Six-pin header means plastic 6-pin plug-in that connects the 6 pin holes. This header is a component, distinct from enveloping words in a data stack for communication at a layer according to a protocol. \n\nJumper denotes a wire with a solid tip at each end which is normally used to interconnect the components on an electronic-circuit breadboard. Jumpers are used for transferring IOs or signals to or from the pins. \n\nInterrupt means an action in which a running program interrupts an hardware signal, such as timer timeout or on execution of a software instruction for interrupt. For example, a program interrupts for sending the data or for accepting a newly added device in the system or on execution of the INT instruction. \n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) means a set of software components and modules which provide the software environment for developing and prototyping. \n\nOperating system (OS) is a system software which facilitates the running of processes, allocation of memory, system calls to the IOs, facilitates the use of network subsystems, and which does devices management, priority allocations of processes and threads, and \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p321_i0.png)\n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 295 \n\nenables multitasking and running of number of threads. The OS enables many system functions using the given computing device hardware. \n\nSection 8.2 describes the embedded computing basics, i.e. embedded devices hardware and software. Sections 8.3 describes the popular embedded devices platforms (Arduino, Intel Galileo and Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, and mBedTM), mobiles and tablets for prototyping and designing for IoT and M2M applications and services. Section 8.4 describes how the devices remain always connected to the Internet and cloud. \n\n8.2 EMBEDDED COMPUTING BASICS \n\nEmbedding means embedding function software into a computing hardware to enable a system function for the specific dedicated applications. A device embeds software into the computing and communication hardware, and the device functions for the applications. \n\nA reader can study in detail the architecture, programming and designing of the embedded systems in this book1. \n\n8.2.1 Embedded Software \n\nSoftware consists of instructions, commands and data. A computing and communicating device needs software. Software does the bootloading and enables the applications and services. The software includes an OS. A device embeds software which also includes the device APIs and middleware which enable the device to perform computing and communication functions. \n\nBootloader \n\nBootloader is a program which runs at the start of a computing device, such as an MCU. A bootloader initiates loading of system software (OS) when the system power is switched on, and power-on-self test completes. \n\nBootloader may also facilitate the use of system hardware and networking capabilities. Bootloader loading of the OS may be from an external source. Alternatively, bootloader can itself function as a system software, when the codes for IO functions and OS basic system functions happen to be from the same source. Booting is said to complete when normal, operational runtime environment is attained. \n\nOperating System \n\nAn operating system (OS) facilitates the use of system hardware and networking capabilities. When a load of the OS into RAM completes then the MCU starts the normal \n\n1Raj Kamal, Embedded Systems\u2014Architecture, Programming and Design, 3rd edition, McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi, 2014. \n\nExplain the basic concept of embedded systems \n\nLO 8.1 \n\n296 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\noperational runtime environment. When the device is executing multiple tasks or threads, then also an OS is required. The OS controls the multiple processes and device functions. Process, task and thread are the set of instructions which run under the control of the OS. The OS enables memory allocation to different processes, and prioritising of the processes enables the use of network hardware and device hardware functions and execution of software components and processes. The OS is at flash memory of the device. It may be required to load functions at the device RAM. \n\nAn OS may be open source, such as Linux or its distribution. Linux distribution means a package or set of software components and modules bundled together for specific functions or for specific hardware, and distributed for wider usages and applications. For example, Arduino Linux distribution runs in Arduino circuit boards and the Linux functions enable developing the application programs for using the Arduino. \n\nReal-Time Operating System \n\nReal-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS that enables real-time execution of processes on computing and communication hardware. RTOS uses prioritisation and priority allocation concept to enable the execution of processes in real-time. \n\n8.2.2 Integrated Development Environment \n\nApplication software codes are perfected by a number of cycle of runs and tests. A cycle in the development phase consists of editing-testing-debugging. The cycles repeat during different development phases till the system has thoroughly tested and debugged the software. A system develops in a larger time-frame than the hardware circuit design. \n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) is a set of software components and modules which provide the software and hardware environment for developing and prototyping. An IDE enables the codes development on a computer, and later on enables download of the codes on the hardware platform. IDE enables software that communicates with the Internet web server or cloud service. \n\nIDE consists of the device APIs, libraries, compilers, RTOS, simulator, editor, assembler, debugger, emulators, logic analyser, application codes\u2019 burner for flash, EPROM and EEPROM and other software components for integrated development of a system. IDE may be open source. For example, Arduino has open source IDE from the Arduino website. \n\nThe IDE or prototype tool enables a prototype design. IDE is used for developing embedded hardware and software platforms, simulating, and debugging. IDE is a tool for software development of embedded devices, which makes application development easy. For example, a software serial library is provided in an IDE for a microcontroller system. The library consists of a number of programs. The library has programs for each serial-interface protocol, which can be used in the device. The program enables using the \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 297 \n\nprotocol-specific programs directly, such as using a program for reading an RFID tag or using a program for sending data to the USB port for onward transmission on the Internet (Section 7.5.1). \n\nSimulator \n\nSimulator is software that enables development on the computer without any hardware, and then prototyping hardware can be connected for embedding the software and further tests. \n\nAPIs and Device Interfaces \n\nRecall Section 1.4.1. Major components of IoT devices are software. Software consists of device Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and device interface for communication over the network and communication circuit/port(s) which also includes a middleware. The middleware creates IPv4, IPv6, 6LowPAN, MQTT, COAP, LWM2M, REST and other communication protocol stacks. \n\nDevice Interfaces \n\nA connectivity interface consists of communication APIs, device interfaces and processing units. Software commands the action on the message or information received followed by hardware port outputs for the actuators. \n\n8.2.3 Embedded Hardware Units \n\nThe hardware includes the following: \n\n\u25cfSingle VLSI (very-large integrated) chip \n\n\u25cfA core in an application specific instruction set processor (ASIP), called MCU \n\n\u25cfA core in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) core \n\n\u25cfA core in System-On-Chip (SoC) or an SoC chip with an SD card for embedded software and operating system (OS) software. Following subsections describe MCU, SoC and selection of platform for prototyping. \n\nMicrocontroller Unit \n\nAn MCU is a single-chip VLSI unit (also called microcomputer) which though having limited computational capabilities, possesses enhanced input-output capability and has a number of on-chip functional units, such as Internal RAM, flash, IO ports, GPIOs, serial interfaces, timers, serial ports and timers. \n\nApplication-specific MCUs have additional on-chip functional units, such as PWM circuits (1, 2 or 3), ADC (1, 2, 4 or higher) and other functional units. Figure 8.1 shows the on-chip functional units in a microcontroller. \n\n298 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nFunctional Circuits in a Chip or Core of Microcontroller (Microcomputer) \n\nProcessor \n\nExternal Memory \n\nInterface \n\nInterrupt Controller \n\nDMA Controller \n\nA/D Converter \n\nPWM Circuit \n\nfor D/A \n\nPrinter Controller \n\nModem DTMF Circuit \n\nI/O Ports Control and \n\nInterfaces/ \n\nDrivers \n\nSerial UART Communication \n\nPort \n\nSerial Synchronous Communication \n\nPort \n\nApplication Specific Circuits in Specific Versions \n\nInternal \n\nRAM \n\nInternal Flash/ROM \n\nCAN Controller Network \n\nDriver \n\nStack \n\nand Interfaces \n\nTimers and Watchdog Timer \n\nFigure 8.1 Microcontroller, on-chip functional units and application specific units \n\nAn MCU is an IC chip, available from a number of sources, such as ATMEL, Nexperia, Microchip, Texas Instruments or Intel. A source may manufacture different types, families and groups of MCUs, like ATMEL manufactures AVR\u00ae8 and AVR\u00ae32 families of MCUs. A family of MCUs can have different versions. Following are the considerations when using a specific MCU version from a source, family or group of MCUs. \n\n\u25cfMCU can be of 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit family. \n\n\u25cfMCU clock frequency can be 8 MHz, 16 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz or higher. The clock frequency depends on the version and family. Performance defines number of instructions executed per sec that primarily depends on the clock frequency also. A metric for performance is Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS). Another metric for performance is Million Floating Point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS). \n\n\u25cfMCU includes RAM which can be 4 kB, 16 kB, 32 B or higher. RAM read and write of byte takes an instruction cycle each. RAM is used for temporary variables, stacks and run-time need of the memory. \n\nMicrocontroller chips \n\nare from different sources and are of \n\ndifferent families, groups and versions \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 299 \n\n\u25cfMCU includes EEPROM and flash memory, which may be 512 B, 1 kB, 2 kB, 4 kB, 16 kB, 64 kB, 128 kB, 512 kB or higher. Flash stores the programs, data, tables and required information during building and testing stages, and then stores a final version of the application program in the embedded device. \n\n\u25cfMCU includes timers, I/O ports, GPIO pins, serial synchronous and asynchronous ports and interrupt controllers. \n\n\u25cfMCU includes several functional units in specific version, such as ADC, multi-channel ADC or ADC with programmable positive and negative reference voltage pins, PWMs, RTC, I2C, CAN and USB ports, LCD interface, ZigBee interface, Ethernet, modem or other functional units, depending on a specific source, family, group and version. Example 8.1 gives the basic hardware units in AVR\u00ae8 MCUs and required functional units for many applications. \n\nExample 8.1 \n\nProblem What are the basic hardware units in AVR\u00ae8 group of microcontrollers? What are the advanced features in the AVR\u00ae32? \n\nSolution \n\nATMEL manufactures AVR\u00ae MCUs. Basic hardware units in an AVR\u00ae8 are: \n\n\u25cfAVR\u00ae 8 is an 8-bit MCU. \n\n\u25cfIt has instructions for executing in single-clock cycle. \n\n\u25cfThree groups of AVR MCUs are tiny, mega and xmega. Tiny has 512 B to 16 kB program memory, mega has 4 kB to 512 kB program memory and xmega has 16 kB to 384 kB program memory. \n\n\u25cfApplication-specific additional controller units for LCD, CAN, USB, ZigBee and advanced PWM, and fuse programmable additional FPGA (5 to 40 k gates). \n\n\u25cfIt has on-chip RAM (SDRAM). \n\n\u25cfSerial SPI for synchronous serial communication, USART for serial synchronous-asynchronous receiver and transmitter. Two-wire serial interface (TWI) and in-circuit serial programming (ICSP) through serial interface. \n\n\u25cfADC and analog voltage comparator. \n\n\u25cfThree timer-counters and watchdog timer. \n\n\u25cfFour ports with programmable port pins as input or output. \n\n\u25cfAdditional units as per the version. \n\n\u25cfSerial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is serial communication in master slave mode. SPI signals are master in slave out (MISO), master out slave in (MOSI), CLK (serial clock from master and SS (slave select). \n\n\u25cfAVR\u00ae32 has an 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 32-bit registers, digital signal processing (DSP) instructions, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. These features enable support for video processing. \n\n300 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSystem-on-Chip \n\nComplex embedded devices, such as mobile phones, consist of a circuit which is designed on a single silicon chip. The circuit consists of multiple processors, hardware units and software. An SoC is a system on a VLSI chip that has multiple processors, software and all the needed digital as well as analog circuits\u2019 on chip. An SoC embeds processing circuit with memory and is specific to dedicated application(s) and may have the analog circuits. \n\nSoC may associate an external SD card in a mobile phone. The card stores the external programs and operating system and enables the use of the chip distinctly for distinct purposes. Secure Digital Association created the SDIO (Secure Data Input-Output) card. The card consists of standard, mini, micro or nano form. It consists of flash memory and communication protocol. An SoC can be from different sources, for examples, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. \n\nSelection of Embedded Platform \n\nSelection among the number of different available platforms depends on a number of factors like price, open source availability, ease of application development and needed capabilities, performance required from IoT device and suitability for developing and using for prototyping and designing. \n\nHardware \n\nThe choice, beside the price, of embedded hardware depends on the following: \n\n\u25cfProcessor speed required which depends upon the applications and services. For example, image and video processing need the high-speed processors \n\n\u25cfRAM need which may be 4 kB or higher depending upon the OS and applications. For example, requirement is 256 kB for using the Linux distribution. New generation mobile phones have over one GB RAM. \n\n\u25cfConnection needs to ZigBee, ZigBee IP, Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi or Wired Ethernet for networking using a supporting circuit (shield) \n\n\u25cfUSB host \n\n\u25cfSensor, actuator and controllers interfacing circuits, such as ADC, UART, I2C, SPI, CAN single or multiples \n\n\u25cfPower requirements, V- and V+, 0 V and 3.3 V or 0 V and 5 V or other. \n\nSoftware Platforms and Components \n\nSelection among a number of different available software depends on hardware platform, open source availability of software components, cost of availability or development of other required components for applications and services. \n\nThe choice of embedded software, beside the price, depends on the following: IDE with device APIs, libraries, OS or RTOS, emulator, simulator and other environment components, middleware with communication and Internet protocols, and Cloud and sensor-cloud platform for applications development, data storage and services. \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 301 \n\nExample 8.2 explains a few open source software. \n\nExample 8.2 \n\nProblem Give examples of IoT open source frameworks for implementation tools, web services, middleware and cloud services. \n\nSolution \n\nOpen Source Framework for IoT Implementation \n\nRefer Section 1.4.3. Eclipse IoT (www.iot.eclipse.org) provides open source implementations of a number of standards including MQTT CoAP, LWM2M and services and frameworks that enable an Open Internet of Things software. Eclipse tool work with Lua. An IoT programming language is Lua. IoT can be programmed in any open source language like Python or Java or PHP also using the tools. \n\nArduino development tools provide a set of software that includes an IDE and the Arduino programming language for a hardware specification for interactive electronics that can sense and control more of the physical world (Section 9.3 for details). Middleware \n\nOpenIoT is an open source middleware. It enables communication with sensor clouds and enables cloud- based \u2018sensing as a service\u2019, IoTSyS is middleware. It enables provisioning of communication stack for smart devices using IPv6 and a number of other standard protocols (Section 1.4.4). \n\nWeb Services \n\nWeb server or cloud server or clients use SOAP, REST, JSON, HTTP, HTTPS, web sockets, web APIs, URI. (Section 3.4) These provide the building blocks (software components) for writing the codes for Web Services. \n\nCloud Applications Development Platforms Refer Section 6.4. The cloud-based development platforms are also widely used for IoT because of world wide availability, storage and platform specific features. \n\nXively (Pachube/Cosm) is another cloud application development platform for sensor data. Xively is open source for basic services (Section 6.4.1). It is software and server platform for data capture, data visualization real-time and other features over the Internet. It is an open source platform for Arduino open- source electronics prototyping platform connectivity with web. Nimbits enables IoT on an open source distributed cloud. PaaS at the Nimbits cloud deploys an instance of Nimbits server at the device nodes (Section 6.4.2). \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cfIoT design needs hardware, sensors, actuators, embedded platform, interfaces, firmware, communication protocols, Internet connections, data storage, analytics and machine learning tools. \n\n\u25cfPrototype design for IoT embedded systems and circuits for sensors and actuators need the devices for computations and communications. A device consists of hardware which consists of a microcontroller, ASIC or SoC. The device software embeds for its functions. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p328_i0.png)\n\n302 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSelf-Assessment Exercise \n\n1.

Examples are OpenIoT and Eclipse IoT stack. \n\n\u25cfCloud-based application development platform, such as Xively or Nimbits, Device Hub, Cloud.com, Cisco IoT, IOx and Fog, IBM Bluemix, TCS CUP can be used. \n\n8.3 EMBEDDED PLATFORMS FOR PROTOTYPING \n\nDesigning a product needs a prototype development first. A standard source board enables prototyping, an easy task for number of IoT and M2M devices. This is because of the open source availabilities of IDE, middleware and software components from number of sources and forums for the board. \n\nSeveral standard popular boards, modules and supporting circuits (shields) are available from a number of sources. Following subsections describe the features and usages of Arduino, Intel\u00ae Galileo and Edison, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone and mBed boards. A board uses MCU as embedding platform for creating the IoT, M2M and wearable devices. \n\nCategorise the embedded device platforms, mobiles and \n\ntablets for prototyping \n\nand designing of IoT and M2M based \n\nsystems \n\nLO 8.2 \n\nNote: \u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M 303 \n\n8.3.1 Arduino \n\nArduino boards, modules and shields are popular AVR\u00ae MCU- based products. Each board has clear markings on the connection pins, sockets and in-circuit connections. Thus, Arduino boards are easy to work for DIY (do-it-yourself) and simplify the prototyping of embedded platforms for IoTs. \n\nThe IDEs are open source. Arduino boards are thus easy to program. For example, Arduino Uno board is a robust as well as widely used board to get started with electronics and coding. Uno is most used and documented board of the whole Arduino family at present. \n\nThe board\u2019s analog input pins and PWM pins can connect sensors, actuators and analog circuits. The board\u2019s digital I/O pins can connect On-Off states, set of On-Off states, digital inputs from sensors, digital outputs to actuators and other digital circuits. A board with a shield inserted into it makes a wireless connection to a ZigBee, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, GSM, or RF module or a wired connection to Ethernet LAN for the Internet. \n\nDevelopment boards for IoT devices are the Arduino Ethernet, Arduino Wi-Fi and Arduino GSM shields. Development boards for the wearable devices are Arduino Gemma, LilyPad, LilyPad Simple/SimpleSnap and LilyPad USB. \n\nA board has pre-programmed bootloader in the MCU. Bootloader software program embeds onto the AVR\u00ae MCU chip. Bootloader can also be downloaded using USB connection to a computer or tablet. Bootloader enables use of the AVR platform with the Arduino IDE. Bootloader enables the board functions. The board needs no OS after bootloading by default. An OS can be embedded when required, for example, when system needs to do multiple tasks or needs to run multiple threads or processes. When a programmer develops the codes using an IDE, the codes are pushed into the MCU using USB port of the board. The codes are pushed after developing-testing-debugging cycle (s). \n\nA programmer develops the codes using the editor in an IDE. Then these are downloaded onto the board, tested and debugged. This constitutes one cycle. Downloading is through a USB port interconnecting the board and external computer or tablet with an IDE. The cycle needs to be repeated till the codes are finalized for a prototype. \n\nFigure 8.2 shows architecture of Arduino Fio board with Ethernet shield. \n\nIoT Applications \n\nAn Arduino application can be an embedded-device data-connectivity to the Internet and data store on cloud. Example of an Arduino application for IoT is Internet of streetlights (Example 1.2). Arduino board find applications where the device does not require intensive computing and graphics. The applications are using things which are light- emitting devices, wearable devices, health monitoring or fitness devices, watches, sensors and actuators connected smartly through the Internet. The developments tools are open sources that use the computer with Windows, Arduino Linux distribution or a MAC. \n\nArduino boards AVR MCU based products, \n\nmodules and shields \n\nare popular and use the for easy prototype \n\ndevelopment \n\n304 Internet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\n3.3V \n\nUART \n\nReset GND \n\n12 Digital IO pins Tx Rx \n\n5V GND Vin \n\nVRef Digital \n\nGND \n\nUSB Mini \n\nEEPROM \n\n1kB \n\nSRAM \n\n2kB \n\nReset Button \n\n6-ICSP \n\nPins \n\nExternal Power Supply \n\nFlash 32 kB \n\nMicrocontroller ATMega328P/8 MHz \n\n6-Analog Inputs \n\nFigure 8.2 Architecture of Arduino Fio board for development IoT devices development \n\nFeatures Arduino Uno \n\nArduino Uno is a reference model for the Arduino platform. The Uno is an MCU board. It includes an ICSP 6-pin header, which enables embedding (burning) of programs. The process of programming an EEPROM/ROM is called burning.
