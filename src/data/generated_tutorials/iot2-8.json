Physical objects or things embedded with electronics, \nsoftware and sensors connect to the Internet. They communicate data to applications and services. \nIoT enables achieving greater value and service by exchanging data with the manufacturer, \noperator and connected devices. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through a computing \nsystem embedded into that and each system is able to interoperate within the existing Internet \ninfrastructure. \n\nRecall the examples of applications of IoT or M2M systems from the previous chapters. \nExamples were given for applications and services for streetlights, smart homes, and traffic \nsignalling control and monitoring, ATMs, automatic chocolate vending machines, predictive \nanalytics and maintenance of vehicles, parking and waste container management services. \n\nEach system needs electronic circuits for computation and communication. The circuits \nuse the sensors and actuator devices, which embed the computing hardware and software. \nAn embedded device means a device, which embeds software into a computing platform and \nperforms the computations and communication for specific systems. \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n293 \n\n8.1 \nINTRODUCTION \n\nRefer to IoT and M2M architecture concepts (Section 1.3). Devices generate data. The data \nis generated using embedded devices, sensors and systems at the physical layer. The data \nneeds computations at a data-adaptation gateway. Enriched data communicates through \nthe Internet for analytics, visualisation, knowledge discovery, applications and services. \n\nA system needs electronic circuits for computation and communication. The circuits \nuse sensors and actuator devices, which embed the computing hardware and software. \nPrototyping and designing require the embedded device platforms for data generation. \nThis also requires connectivity to the Internet through computations, adaptation and \nnetworking. The software at application and application-support layer monitor and \ncontrol the embedded devices, systems and machines using the actuators at the devices. \n\nFollowing are some key terms, which need to be understood when learning principles \nof prototype designing for creating the devices for IoTs and M2M applications: \n\nEmbedded system denotes a system that embeds software into a computing platform. The \nsystem is dedicated for either an application(s), specific part of an application, product or \na component of a large system. \n\nEmbedded device refers to a device, which embeds software into a computing platform and \nperforms the computations and communication for specific systems. \n\nMicrocontroller unit (MCU) means a single-chip VLSI unit (also called microcomputer), \nwhich may be having limited computational capabilities. The MCU possesses memory, \nflash, enhanced input-output capabilities and a number of on-chip functional units. \n\nTimer refers to a device which enables initiating new action(s) on timer start, on the clock \ninputs, time outs or when the number of clock inputs equal to a preset value. \n\nPort refers to a device that enables input output (IO) communication between the MCU \nand another device such as a sensor or actuator or keypad or with an external computing \ndevice. \n\nUSB port connects the device hardware to a computer, downloads the developed codes \ninto the device from the computer, or sends the codes from the device to the computer. \nUSB port can also provide the power for charging the battery of the connected platform, \nthus an external charger is not needed. \n\nGPIO pins refer to General Purpose Input-Output pins. A pin that can be used in addition \nto digital input and output for other purposes, such as Rx and Tx or SDA and SCK, PWMs, \nanalog inputs, outputs or timer outputs. The Rx and Tx pins are used during UART \nprotocol-based reception and transmission, SDA and SCK are used during use of I2C \nprotocol-based serial data and clock communication. \n\n294 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nBoard is an electronic hardware\u2014an electronic circuit board with MCU or SoC, circuits \nand connectors, which provide the connections to other ICs and circuit components. The \nICs and circuit components can also be inserted or joined or put in place onto the board, \nby surface mount technology. The board may also have battery, power supply, voltage \nregulator or connections for the power. \n\nPlatform denotes a set consisting of computing and communication hardware, software \nand operating system (OS). A platform enables working with different software, APIs, IDE \nand middleware. A platform may enable the development of codes at the development \nstage. It may also enable prototype development for an application(s) or specific parts of \nan application. \n\nModule (hardware) is smaller form-factor hardware which can be placed onto a board. The \nmodule may embed the software. It may enable use of the board circuit with shorter form \nfactor. An example is RF module placed onto an electronic board. \n\nShield means a supporting circuit with connection pins, socket(s) and supporting software. \nThe supporting circuit enables the connectivity of a board or computing platform to \nexternal circuits. The circuit connects the elements that can be plugged onto a board or \nplatform. Usage of the supporting circuit provides extra features, such as connectivity \nto wireless devices, such as ZigBee, ZigBee IP, and Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi or GSM or RF \nmodule or to a wired device, such as Ethernet shield. The Ethernet shield enables wired \nconnection of a platform to the Ethernet controller and through an external standard LAN \nsocket enables connectivity to a wired or Wi-Fi modem for the Internet. Shield is the term \nused in Arduino hardware for the supporting circuits. \n\nHeader means plastic-coated strip or plastic-capped plug-in which is placed on top of the \npin holes when making connection of the wires without electronic soldering. A header \nalso provides jumpers. Six-pin header means plastic 6-pin plug-in that connects the 6 \npin holes. This header is a component, distinct from enveloping words in a data stack for \ncommunication at a layer according to a protocol. \n\nJumper denotes a wire with a solid tip at each end which is normally used to interconnect \nthe components on an electronic-circuit breadboard. Jumpers are used for transferring \nIOs or signals to or from the pins. \n\nInterrupt means an action in which a running program interrupts an hardware signal, \nsuch as timer timeout or on execution of a software instruction for interrupt. For example, \na program interrupts for sending the data or for accepting a newly added device in the \nsystem or on execution of the INT instruction. \n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) means a set of software components and modules \nwhich provide the software environment for developing and prototyping. \n\nOperating system (OS) is a system software which facilitates the running of processes, \nallocation of memory, system calls to the IOs, facilitates the use of network subsystems, \nand which does devices management, priority allocations of processes and threads, and \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p321_i0.png)\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n295 \n\nenables multitasking and running of number of threads. The OS enables many system \nfunctions using the given computing device hardware. \n\nSection 8.2 describes the embedded computing basics, i.e. embedded devices hardware \nand software. Sections 8.3 describes the popular embedded devices platforms (Arduino, \nIntel Galileo and Edison, Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, and mBed TM ), mobiles and tablets \nfor prototyping and designing for IoT and M2M applications and services. Section 8.4 \ndescribes how the devices remain always connected to the Internet and cloud. \n\n8.2 \nEMBEDDED COMPUTING BASICS \n\nEmbedding means embedding function software into a \ncomputing hardware to enable a system function for the \nspecific dedicated applications. A device embeds software \ninto the computing and communication hardware, and the \ndevice functions for the applications. \n\nA reader can study in detail the architecture, programming and designing of the \nembedded systems in this book 1 . \n\n8.2.1 \nEmbedded Software \n\nSoftware consists of instructions, commands and data. A computing and communicating \ndevice needs software. Software does the bootloading and enables the applications and \nservices. The software includes an OS. A device embeds software which also includes \nthe device APIs and middleware which enable the device to perform computing and \ncommunication functions. \n\nBootloader \n\nBootloader is a program which runs at the start of a computing device, such as an MCU. A \nbootloader initiates loading of system software (OS) when the system power is switched \non, and power-on-self test completes. \n\nBootloader may also facilitate the use of system hardware and networking capabilities. \nBootloader loading of the OS may be from an external source. Alternatively, bootloader \ncan itself function as a system software, when the codes for IO functions and OS basic \nsystem functions happen to be from the same source. Booting is said to complete when \nnormal, operational runtime environment is attained. \n\nOperating System \n\nAn operating system (OS) facilitates the use of system hardware and networking \ncapabilities. When a load of the OS into RAM completes then the MCU starts the normal \n\n1 Raj Kamal, Embedded Systems\u2014Architecture, Programming and Design, 3 rd edition, McGraw-Hill Education, New Delhi, 2014. \n\nExplain the \nbasic concept of \nembedded systems \n\nLO 8.1 \n\n296 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\noperational runtime environment. When the device is executing multiple tasks or threads, \nthen also an OS is required. The OS controls the multiple processes and device functions. \nProcess, task and thread are the set of instructions which run under the control of the OS. \nThe OS enables memory allocation to different processes, and prioritising of the processes \nenables the use of network hardware and device hardware functions and execution of \nsoftware components and processes. The OS is at flash memory of the device. It may be \nrequired to load functions at the device RAM. \n\nAn OS may be open source, such as Linux or its distribution. Linux distribution means \na package or set of software components and modules bundled together for specific \nfunctions or for specific hardware, and distributed for wider usages and applications. \nFor example, Arduino Linux distribution runs in Arduino circuit boards and the Linux \nfunctions enable developing the application programs for using the Arduino. \n\nReal-Time Operating System \n\nReal-Time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS that enables real-time execution of processes \non computing and communication hardware. RTOS uses prioritisation and priority \nallocation concept to enable the execution of processes in real-time. \n\n8.2.2 \nIntegrated Development Environment \n\nApplication software codes are perfected by a number of cycle of runs and tests. A cycle \nin the development phase consists of editing-testing-debugging. The cycles repeat during \ndifferent development phases till the system has thoroughly tested and debugged the \nsoftware. A system develops in a larger time-frame than the hardware circuit design. \n\nIntegrated Development Environment (IDE) is a set of software components and modules \nwhich provide the software and hardware environment for developing and prototyping. \nAn IDE enables the codes development on a computer, and later on enables download of \nthe codes on the hardware platform. IDE enables software that communicates with the \nInternet web server or cloud service. \n\nIDE consists of the device APIs, libraries, compilers, RTOS, simulator, editor, assembler, \ndebugger, emulators, logic analyser, application codes\u2019 burner for flash, EPROM and \nEEPROM and other software components for integrated development of a system. IDE \nmay be open source. For example, Arduino has open source IDE from the Arduino website. \n\nThe IDE or prototype tool enables a prototype design. IDE is used for developing \nembedded hardware and software platforms, simulating, and debugging. IDE is a tool \nfor software development of embedded devices, which makes application development \neasy. For example, a software serial library is provided in an IDE for a microcontroller \nsystem. The library consists of a number of programs. The library has programs for each \nserial-interface protocol, which can be used in the device. The program enables using the \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n297 \n\nprotocol-specific programs directly, such as using a program for reading an RFID tag or \nusing a program for sending data to the USB port for onward transmission on the Internet \n(Section 7.5.1). \n\nSimulator \n\nSimulator is software that enables development on the computer without any hardware, \nand then prototyping hardware can be connected for embedding the software and further \ntests. \n\nAPIs and Device Interfaces \n\nRecall Section 1.4.1. Major components of IoT devices are software. Software consists of \ndevice Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and device interface for communication \nover the network and communication circuit/port(s) which also includes a middleware. \nThe middleware creates IPv4, IPv6, 6LowPAN, MQTT, COAP, LWM2M, REST and other \ncommunication protocol stacks. \n\nDevice Interfaces \n\nA connectivity interface consists of communication APIs, device interfaces and processing \nunits. Software commands the action on the message or information received followed by \nhardware port outputs for the actuators. \n\n8.2.3 \nEmbedded Hardware Units \n\nThe hardware includes the following: \n\n\u25cf Single VLSI (very-large integrated) chip \n\n\u25cf A core in an application specific instruction set processor (ASIP), called MCU \n\n\u25cf A core in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) core \n\n\u25cf A core in System-On-Chip (SoC) or an SoC chip with an SD card for embedded \nsoftware and operating system (OS) software. \nFollowing subsections describe MCU, SoC and selection of platform for prototyping. \n\nMicrocontroller Unit \n\nAn MCU is a single-chip VLSI unit (also called microcomputer) which though having \nlimited computational capabilities, possesses enhanced input-output capability and has a \nnumber of on-chip functional units, such as Internal RAM, flash, IO ports, GPIOs, serial \ninterfaces, timers, serial ports and timers. \n\nApplication-specific MCUs have additional on-chip functional units, such as PWM \ncircuits (1, 2 or 3), ADC (1, 2, 4 or higher) and other functional units. Figure 8.1 shows the \non-chip functional units in a microcontroller. \n\n298 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nFunctional Circuits in a Chip or Core of Microcontroller (Microcomputer) \n\nProcessor \n\nExternal Memory \n\nInterface \n\nInterrupt \nController \n\nDMA \nController \n\nA/D \nConverter \n\nPWM \nCircuit \n\nfor \nD/A \n\nPrinter \nController \n\nModem \nDTMF \nCircuit \n\nI/O Ports \nControl and \n\nInterfaces/ \n\nDrivers \n\nSerial UART \nCommunication \n\nPort \n\nSerial \nSynchronous \nCommunication \n\nPort \n\nApplication Specific Circuits in Specific Versions \n\nInternal \n\nRAM \n\nInternal \nFlash/ROM \n\nCAN \nController \nNetwork \n\nDriver \n\nStack \n\nand \nInterfaces \n\nTimers and \nWatchdog Timer \n\nFigure 8.1 \nMicrocontroller, on-chip functional units and application specific units \n\nAn MCU is an IC chip, available from a number of sources, \nsuch as ATMEL, Nexperia, Microchip, Texas Instruments or \nIntel. A source may manufacture different types, families and \ngroups of MCUs, like ATMEL manufactures AVR \u00ae 8 and AVR \u00ae 32 \nfamilies of MCUs. A family of MCUs can have different versions. \nFollowing are the considerations when using a specific MCU \nversion from a source, family or group of MCUs. \n\n\u25cf MCU can be of 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit family. \n\n\u25cf MCU clock frequency can be 8 MHz, 16 MHz, 100 MHz, 200 MHz or higher. The \nclock frequency depends on the version and family. Performance defines number of \ninstructions executed per sec that primarily depends on the clock frequency also. A \nmetric for performance is Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS). Another metric for \nperformance is Million Floating Point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS). \n\n\u25cf MCU includes RAM which can be 4 kB, 16 kB, 32 B or higher. RAM read and write of \nbyte takes an instruction cycle each. RAM is used for temporary variables, stacks and \nrun-time need of the memory. \n\nMicrocontroller chips \n\nare from different \nsources and are of \n\ndifferent families, \ngroups and versions \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n299 \n\n\u25cf MCU includes EEPROM and flash memory, which may be 512 B, 1 kB, 2 kB, 4 kB, 16 kB, \n64 kB, 128 kB, 512 kB or higher. Flash stores the programs, data, tables and required \ninformation during building and testing stages, and then stores a final version of the \napplication program in the embedded device. \n\n\u25cf MCU includes timers, I/O ports, GPIO pins, serial synchronous and asynchronous \nports and interrupt controllers. \n\n\u25cf MCU includes several functional units in specific version, such as ADC, multi-channel \nADC or ADC with programmable positive and negative reference voltage pins, PWMs, \nRTC, I2C, CAN and USB ports, LCD interface, ZigBee interface, Ethernet, modem or \nother functional units, depending on a specific source, family, group and version. \nExample 8.1 gives the basic hardware units in AVR \u00ae 8 MCUs and required functional \nunits for many applications. \n\nExample 8.1 \n\nProblem \nWhat are the basic hardware units in AVR \u00ae 8 group of microcontrollers? What are the advanced features in \nthe AVR \u00ae 32? \n\nSolution \n\nATMEL manufactures AVR \u00ae MCUs. Basic hardware units in an AVR \u00ae 8 are: \n\n\u25cf AVR \u00ae 8 is an 8-bit MCU. \n\n\u25cf It has instructions for executing in single-clock cycle. \n\n\u25cf Three groups of AVR MCUs are tiny, mega and xmega. Tiny has 512 B to 16 kB program memory, mega \nhas 4 kB to 512 kB program memory and xmega has 16 kB to 384 kB program memory. \n\n\u25cf Application-specific additional controller units for LCD, CAN, USB, ZigBee and advanced PWM, and fuse \nprogrammable additional FPGA (5 to 40 k gates). \n\n\u25cf It has on-chip RAM (SDRAM). \n\n\u25cf Serial SPI for synchronous serial communication, USART for serial synchronous-asynchronous receiver \nand transmitter.

SPI signals are master \nin slave out (MISO), master out slave in (MOSI), CLK (serial clock from master and SS (slave select). \n\n\u25cf AVR \u00ae 32 has an 8-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), 32-bit registers, digital signal processing (DSP) \ninstructions, single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions. These features enable support for \nvideo processing. \n\n300 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nSystem-on-Chip \n\nComplex embedded devices, such as mobile phones, consist of a circuit which is designed \non a single silicon chip. The circuit consists of multiple processors, hardware units and \nsoftware. An SoC is a system on a VLSI chip that has multiple processors, software and all \nthe needed digital as well as analog circuits\u2019 on chip. An SoC embeds processing circuit \nwith memory and is specific to dedicated application(s) and may have the analog circuits. \n\nSoC may associate an external SD card in a mobile phone. The card stores the external \nprograms and operating system and enables the use of the chip distinctly for distinct \npurposes. Secure Digital Association created the SDIO (Secure Data Input-Output) card. \nThe card consists of standard, mini, micro or nano form. It consists of flash memory and \ncommunication protocol. An SoC can be from different sources, for examples, Raspberry \nPi and BeagleBone. \n\nSelection of Embedded Platform \n\nSelection among the number of different available platforms depends on a number of \nfactors like price, open source availability, ease of application development and needed \ncapabilities, performance required from IoT device and suitability for developing and \nusing for prototyping and designing. \n\nHardware \n\nThe choice, beside the price, of embedded hardware depends on the following: \n\n\u25cf Processor speed required which depends upon the applications and services. For \nexample, image and video processing need the high-speed processors \n\n\u25cf RAM need which may be 4 kB or higher depending upon the OS and applications. \nFor example, requirement is 256 kB for using the Linux distribution. New generation \nmobile phones have over one GB RAM. \n\n\u25cf Connection needs to ZigBee, ZigBee IP, Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi or Wired Ethernet for \nnetworking using a supporting circuit (shield) \n\n\u25cf USB host \n\n\u25cf Sensor, actuator and controllers interfacing circuits, such as ADC, UART, I2C, SPI, \nCAN single or multiples \n\n\u25cf Power requirements, V- and V+, 0 V and 3.3 V or 0 V and 5 V or other. \n\nSoftware Platforms and Components \n\nSelection among a number of different available software depends on hardware platform, \nopen source availability of software components, cost of availability or development of \nother required components for applications and services. \n\nThe choice of embedded software, beside the price, depends on the following: IDE \nwith device APIs, libraries, OS or RTOS, emulator, simulator and other environment \ncomponents, middleware with communication and Internet protocols, and Cloud and \nsensor-cloud platform for applications development, data storage and services. \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n301 \n\nExample 8.2 explains a few open source software. \n\nExample 8.2 \n\nProblem \nGive examples of IoT open source frameworks for implementation tools, web services, middleware and cloud \nservices. \n\nSolution \n\nOpen Source Framework for IoT Implementation \n\nRefer Section 1.4.3. Eclipse IoT (www.iot.eclipse.org) provides open source implementations of a number of \nstandards including MQTT CoAP, LWM2M and services and frameworks that enable an Open Internet of Things \nsoftware. Eclipse tool work with Lua. An IoT programming language is Lua. IoT can be programmed in any \nopen source language like Python or Java or PHP also using the tools. \n\nArduino development tools provide a set of software that includes an IDE and the Arduino programming \nlanguage for a hardware specification for interactive electronics that can sense and control more of the \nphysical world (Section 9.3 for details). \nMiddleware \n\nOpenIoT is an open source middleware. It enables communication with sensor clouds and enables cloud- \nbased \u2018sensing as a service\u2019, IoTSyS is middleware. It enables provisioning of communication stack for smart \ndevices using IPv6 and a number of other standard protocols (Section 1.4.4). \n\nWeb Services \n\nWeb server or cloud server or clients use SOAP, REST, JSON, HTTP, HTTPS, web sockets, web APIs, URI. \n(Section 3.4) These provide the building blocks (software components) for writing the codes for Web \nServices. \n\nCloud Applications Development Platforms \nRefer Section 6.4. The cloud-based development platforms are also widely used for IoT because of world \nwide availability, storage and platform specific features. \n\nXively (Pachube/Cosm) is another cloud application development platform for sensor data. Xively is \nopen source for basic services (Section 6.4.1). It is software and server platform for data capture, data \nvisualization real-time and other features over the Internet. It is an open source platform for Arduino open- \nsource electronics prototyping platform connectivity with web. \nNimbits enables IoT on an open source distributed cloud. PaaS at the Nimbits cloud deploys an instance of \nNimbits server at the device nodes (Section 6.4.2). \n\nReconfirm Your Understanding \n\n\u25cf IoT design needs hardware, sensors, actuators, embedded platform, interfaces, firmware, \ncommunication protocols, Internet connections, data storage, analytics and machine learning tools. \n\n\u25cf Prototype design for IoT embedded systems and circuits for sensors and actuators need the \ndevices for computations and communications. A device consists of hardware which consists of a \nmicrocontroller, ASIC or SoC. The device software embeds for its functions. \n\n\n![Image](/src/assets/generated_images/iot2_p328_i0.png)\n302 \nInternet of Things: Architecture and Design Principles \n\nS elf-Assessment E xercise \n\n1.

Examples are OpenIoT and Eclipse IoT stack. \n\n\u25cf Cloud-based application development platform, such as Xively or Nimbits, Device Hub, Cloud.com, \nCisco IoT, IOx and Fog, IBM Bluemix, TCS CUP can be used. \n\n8.3 \nEMBEDDED PLATFORMS FOR \nPROTOTYPING \n\nDesigning a product needs a prototype development first. \nA standard source board enables prototyping, an easy task \nfor number of IoT and M2M devices. This is because of the \nopen source availabilities of IDE, middleware and software \ncomponents from number of sources and forums for the \nboard. \n\nSeveral standard popular boards, modules and supporting circuits (shields) are available \nfrom a number of sources. Following subsections describe the features and usages of \nArduino, Intel \u00ae Galileo and Edison, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone and mBed boards. A board \nuses MCU as embedding platform for creating the IoT, M2M and wearable devices. \n\nCategorise the \nembedded device \nplatforms, mobiles and \n\ntablets for prototyping \n\nand designing of \nIoT and M2M based \n\nsystems \n\nLO 8.2 \n\nNote: \n\u2605 Level 1 & Level 2 category \n\n\u2605\u2605 Level 3 & Level 4 category \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 Level 5 & Level 6 category \n\nPrototyping the Embedded Devices for IoT and M2M \n303 \n\n8.3.1 Arduino \n\nArduino boards, modules and shields are popular AVR \u00ae MCU- \nbased products. Each board has clear markings on the connection \npins, sockets and in-circuit connections. Thus, Arduino boards \nare easy to work for DIY (do-it-yourself) and simplify the \nprototyping of embedded platforms for IoTs. \n\nThe IDEs are open source. Arduino boards are thus easy to \nprogram. For example, Arduino Uno board is a robust as well as widely used board to \nget started with electronics and coding. Uno is most used and documented board of the \nwhole Arduino family at present. \n\nThe board\u2019s analog input pins and PWM pins can connect sensors, actuators and analog \ncircuits. The board\u2019s digital I/O pins can connect On-Off states, set of On-Off states, digital \ninputs from sensors, digital outputs to actuators and other digital circuits. A board with a \nshield inserted into it makes a wireless connection to a ZigBee, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, GSM, \nor RF module or a wired connection to Ethernet LAN for the Internet. \n\nDevelopment boards for IoT devices are the Arduino Ethernet, Arduino Wi-Fi and \nArduino GSM shields. Development boards for the wearable devices are Arduino Gemma, \nLilyPad, LilyPad Simple/SimpleSnap and LilyPad USB. \n\nA board has pre-programmed bootloader in the MCU. Bootloader software program \nembeds onto the AVR \u00ae MCU chip. Bootloader can also be downloaded using USB \nconnection to a computer or tablet. Bootloader enables use of the AVR platform with \nthe Arduino IDE. Bootloader enables the board functions. The board needs no OS after \nbootloading by default. An OS can be embedded when required, for example, when \nsystem needs to do multiple tasks or needs to run multiple threads or processes. When a \nprogrammer develops the codes using an IDE, the codes are pushed into the MCU using \nUSB port of the board. The codes are pushed after developing-testing-debugging cycle (s). \n\nA programmer develops the codes using the editor in an IDE. Then these are downloaded \nonto the board, tested and debugged. This constitutes one cycle. Downloading is through \na USB port interconnecting the board and external computer or tablet with an IDE. The \ncycle needs to be repeated till the codes are finalized for a prototype. \n\nFigure 8.2 shows architecture of Arduino Fio board with Ethernet shield. \n\nIoT Applications \n\nAn Arduino application can be an embedded-device data-connectivity to the Internet and \ndata store on cloud. Example of an Arduino application for IoT is Internet of streetlights \n(Example 1.2). Arduino board find applications where the device does not require \nintensive computing and graphics.
